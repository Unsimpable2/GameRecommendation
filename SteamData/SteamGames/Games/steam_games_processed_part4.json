The imperial guard of the nearby capital city may prove difficult to avoid. It details the rise of a Wyvern Wraith and the plight of a Witch Wraith.&quot;This Game is an RPG Game and its game play is like WOW in that the game has levels of gear and it also has great graphical terrains of desert scenes and beach scenes.This game is still in development. The Objectives still need to be implemented.This has an advanced inventory and it saves progress this is the completed inventory. The 2nd partial inventory will be adapted over time as the code needs to be coded for each individual object and this takes time. Some are coded in this edition and some are not yet implemented. Inventory &amp; Quests keys: J,K,I. Horse Mount Keys: F.Camera: F1,F2,F3. Keys may differ from Mac to Windows Versions. Q. Dragon Fly/Take off. Use 'E' To interact with NPC's.The RPG Game(Elven Magic 2) is coded with Effects working on most builds and allows for the attack, these effects will have relied on without the use of weapons at this stage as melee combat will be introduced later without the use of guns specifically as a weapon. As the game's storyline will not involve guns for the attack of any humanoids, only creatures will be attacked using guns which will not be implemented like a weapon at all, only in the inventory, although it will take time to lock them.Elven Magic FPS is available and at this stage, you can attack and the Inventory works as well as a character sheet and crafting functioning is coming soon as recipes need to be added. You can also ride a horse on the beach in one scene. Things like purchasing of equipment will be added in time, if there is any please don't get anything in-game due to weather saving functionality works you can get the game still as it is in beta not everything is working. !!!! This product uses no extra bandwidth and this is a feature of the product it requires no further connection to the internet once downloaded if setup/done properly. !!!The Mac Version of the game Elven Magic 2(MAC ONLY) is now like age of empires and has towers which can attack an army at the castle screen FUNC+F1,F2,F3 sorry guys this does not build on a windows system. What i intended to do is expand the towers and attack path across the whole world in time. To get into this game you will need the graphics settings to low at this stage. This Main Game (ElvenMagicPro) is not Required to load and play Elven Magic 2 and Elven Magic SE which are working well. You can often press Function + F1 or F2 or F3 to change the view for example if you press that in the ElvenMagicPro Game it will switch to another persons head from there you can see the holograms and light shining down., in Elven Magic SE you can now look over the sand dunes and see a train this is Simulation assets working as intended.  Prices may change without prior notice.This game can be implemented with over 100GB of content at this stage each build takes only between 2.5GB(MAC)  and 7GB(WINDOWS &amp; MAC) each.",

As it was built to be a game that offered a lot of strategic options during a mission it is not a simple deckbuilder but is a game that requires thought and a bit of time to learn its mechanics.OverviewSiberian Dawn is an original, solo, digital card game that combines the core soul of a deck builder with the tactical power of a war game and the strategic challenge of crisis management.You are an Overseer in the Union, one of the tactical controllers who has to deal with the increasing dangers facing the Union through Objective based Missions. Recruit and deploy Units, enlist the help of the Guilds, and build your Bond with those in the shadows, whilst trying to control the conflict unfolding before you.The base game contains a detailed series of 4 interactive tutorials, that will take you through how to play the game, and then you can play the 4 Training Mission that are specially designed to be your first proper test of playing a mission.After you have been through the training you can then tackle the V Missions, which are 3 full missions that tell a contained story and give you the full challenge of Siberian Dawn, with the full Union and Guild cards available to you.The base game also contains Skirmish mode, a more combat orientated mission where you have to kill X Rank worth of enemy in 30 Rounds. There are 2 Skirmish missions available in the base game, and a Skirmish 0 which takes all the content owned and mixes in all together in an epic challenge.Beyond the base game are the Mission Packs available as DLC, which each one adding 3 new full Missions of the Siberian Dawn story and 1 Skirmish mission unique to that DLC. All the content in the DLC packs will also be added to Skirmish 0 to make that even more crazy.The WorldIn Siberian Dawn you play the part of an Overseer in the Union, an industrial state covering what we know as Europe. Overseers are the tactical experts of the Union and responsible for quickly dealing with troubles as they arise using a limited resource pool, controlled squad level force, and possible support from the Guilds. Siberian Dawn has a heavy character driven setting, in a gritty near future military world that mixes in medieval and supernatural horror elements to the theme.The game starts as hostility has been growing in Industrial Habit IH-54 of the Eastern Zones for the last few weeks. Outcasts are rumoured to have been stirring up this dissent and it is believed they are connected to a cult called the Dawn, Overseers have been assigned to deal with this unrest and you are one of them. Each Mission will give the Overseer a series of Objectives to complete which have variety and offer the Overseer different challenges during the Mission. Missions will be playable individually but also form a narrative story as the Overseer uncovers the truth of the Dawn and how deep secrets go within the Union and Guilds.Mission ExampleAn example Training mission in the  base game is First Run, which is aimed to give you a taste of Siberian Dawn and the basics of a Mission. The Objectives in this Mission will take you through the steps towards the final Objective to kill the 4 VBots, the Missions in Mission Pack 1 and those to follow will contain multiple Objectives offering a longer more challenging game. First Run also contains 2 Units, the Grunt and the Scribe. The Grunt is your basic Union military Unit that will be used to attack the VBots, and the Scribe is a Guild support Unit who will help you gain Glory. Full Missions add 18 new Units to these 2 basic ones.The ARKThe ARK is the meta section of the game representing your memories as an Overseer in Siberian Dawn. When you complete a mission you earn ARK Points and this is where you can use them to unlock memories and other elements that let you change your Siberian Dawn reality.More than 80 Content Pods hold the data and lore for most of the cards in the game, which will give you insight into what these cards bring to Siberian Dawn, as well as expanding what you know about the world.There are also a couple of modifications that can be activated in the ARK. Echoes is an option that can be activated in the ARK to change a basic event into one that for the cost of ARK Points will boost your Glory, and Nemesis is a special enemy that can turn up in a mission after you have killed the related Boss in Skirmish mode to give a greater challenge but with the reward of ARK points for killing them.Lore EngineSiberian Dawn is the first game to use the Lore Deck Building Engine, taking the core of a Deck Builder and adding the depth of a War Game to give the player a more strategic challenge.Dual Deck Development – Build a Resource deck and Tactics deck.Bond System – Adds 1 of 4 Guild specific contacts in a Mission (Available with Mission Pack 1)Hub System – Context relevant controls presented on a central set of pods.Fate Helix – Action resolution using a deck system allowing control over the risk of the results.Multiple Resource Management – Overseer has to balance a range of Resources to succeed.Tactical Range – Overseer has a range of distinct Units and Tactics to dominate the Missions.Mission Variety – Each Mission has a series of Objectives to give a variety of challenges.",

As it was built to be a game that offered a lot of strategic options during a mission it is not a simple deckbuilder but is a game that requires thought and a bit of time to learn its mechanics.OverviewSiberian Dawn is an original, solo, digital card game that combines the core soul of a deck builder with the tactical power of a war game and the strategic challenge of crisis management.You are an Overseer in the Union, one of the tactical controllers who has to deal with the increasing dangers facing the Union through Objective based Missions. Recruit and deploy Units, enlist the help of the Guilds, and build your Bond with those in the shadows, whilst trying to control the conflict unfolding before you.The base game contains a detailed series of 4 interactive tutorials, that will take you through how to play the game, and then you can play the 4 Training Mission that are specially designed to be your first proper test of playing a mission.After you have been through the training you can then tackle the V Missions, which are 3 full missions that tell a contained story and give you the full challenge of Siberian Dawn, with the full Union and Guild cards available to you.The base game also contains Skirmish mode, a more combat orientated mission where you have to kill X Rank worth of enemy in 30 Rounds. There are 2 Skirmish missions available in the base game, and a Skirmish 0 which takes all the content owned and mixes in all together in an epic challenge.Beyond the base game are the Mission Packs available as DLC, which each one adding 3 new full Missions of the Siberian Dawn story and 1 Skirmish mission unique to that DLC. All the content in the DLC packs will also be added to Skirmish 0 to make that even more crazy.The WorldIn Siberian Dawn you play the part of an Overseer in the Union, an industrial state covering what we know as Europe. Overseers are the tactical experts of the Union and responsible for quickly dealing with troubles as they arise using a limited resource pool, controlled squad level force, and possible support from the Guilds. Siberian Dawn has a heavy character driven setting, in a gritty near future military world that mixes in medieval and supernatural horror elements to the theme.The game starts as hostility has been growing in Industrial Habit IH-54 of the Eastern Zones for the last few weeks. Outcasts are rumoured to have been stirring up this dissent and it is believed they are connected to a cult called the Dawn, Overseers have been assigned to deal with this unrest and you are one of them. Each Mission will give the Overseer a series of Objectives to complete which have variety and offer the Overseer different challenges during the Mission. Missions will be playable individually but also form a narrative story as the Overseer uncovers the truth of the Dawn and how deep secrets go within the Union and Guilds.Mission ExampleAn example Training mission in the  base game is First Run, which is aimed to give you a taste of Siberian Dawn and the basics of a Mission. The Objectives in this Mission will take you through the steps towards the final Objective to kill the 4 VBots, the Missions in Mission Pack 1 and those to follow will contain multiple Objectives offering a longer more challenging game. First Run also contains 2 Units, the Grunt and the Scribe. The Grunt is your basic Union military Unit that will be used to attack the VBots, and the Scribe is a Guild support Unit who will help you gain Glory. Full Missions add 18 new Units to these 2 basic ones.The ARKThe ARK is the meta section of the game representing your memories as an Overseer in Siberian Dawn. When you complete a mission you earn ARK Points and this is where you can use them to unlock memories and other elements that let you change your Siberian Dawn reality.More than 80 Content Pods hold the data and lore for most of the cards in the game, which will give you insight into what these cards bring to Siberian Dawn, as well as expanding what you know about the world.There are also a couple of modifications that can be activated in the ARK. Echoes is an option that can be activated in the ARK to change a basic event into one that for the cost of ARK Points will boost your Glory, and Nemesis is a special enemy that can turn up in a mission after you have killed the related Boss in Skirmish mode to give a greater challenge but with the reward of ARK points for killing them.Lore EngineSiberian Dawn is the first game to use the Lore Deck Building Engine, taking the core of a Deck Builder and adding the depth of a War Game to give the player a more strategic challenge.Dual Deck Development – Build a Resource deck and Tactics deck.Bond System – Adds 1 of 4 Guild specific contacts in a Mission (Available with Mission Pack 1)Hub System – Context relevant controls presented on a central set of pods.Fate Helix – Action resolution using a deck system allowing control over the risk of the results.Multiple Resource Management – Overseer has to balance a range of Resources to succeed.Tactical Range – Overseer has a range of distinct Units and Tactics to dominate the Missions.Mission Variety – Each Mission has a series of Objectives to give a variety of challenges.",

There is no in-app purchase mall for points, points are earned during the game. The number of points earned depends on the player's skill, experience. and on good outcomes against other player's (adversaries) online. The main difference from other games is that this game doesn't require you to accumulate points through a lot of playing time.

        "Detailed Description": "A tactical sci-fi RPG set in a dystopian environment allowing you to fight enemies, explore the hostile wasteland, level up your character and join one of the factions – made up of survivors - in the shattered world and cut off from the rest of society.Enrolling in one of the five wings of the CRONUS Corporation - each with its own features, mechanics and game options - and embark on a one way trip inside the Dome in the quest for unique artifacts as you avoid radiation, anomalies and a whole host of creatures out to do you harm. You may start as an ordinary company employee but you will eventually become the driving force behind the narrative that takes place before, during, and after the disaster known as ‘The Incident’.Crafting, combat, negotiation; you’re going to need all your wits about you if you want to survive.Once you’re familiar with the basics, you are thrust into an open world filled with riches and danger. The old ways are gone – ground into dust by the powerful Maelstrom – and rising from the ashes are six powerful factions, vying for control over the ravaged landscape under the Dome. Will they be allies or enemies? That choice – and the future of the Dome – is in your hands.  Not everyone under the Dome is your friend; quite the reverse in fact. If you’re a smart likeable character (with a high charisma rating) you might be able to talk your way out of things. But more likely it’s time for a bit of ultra-violence. And that means weapons; lots of weapons. And there’s no shortage of choice: from high tech beam weapons through to a solid right hook, there’s loads of way to bring down a hostile group of foes. Of course, you can be a pacifist and use non-lethal force but that’s a story for another day…The hostile and unforgiving world can be a lonely place; so why not team up with some like-minded individuals and face the challenges together. From hardened criminals built like mountains or scientists with a shady past, there’s a host of different potential companions to journey with, each replete with their own unique personality and skills. Or you can just go “Lone Wolf” and face everything alone; it’s not an easy road but you can play this way too if you so wish.Encased is full of choices: from what sort of character you will be, what wing you will join and how honourable a person you are. What equipment do you take? How will you fight? Do you craft better weapons or armour? And it doesn’t stop there. You will hold lives in the balance and will have to choose who survives and who perishes. And every decision you make will impact the story and your gaming experience. Well, no one said surviving Armageddon was going to be easy…",

Of course, you can be a pacifist and use non-lethal force but that’s a story for another day…The hostile and unforgiving world can be a lonely place; so why not team up with some like-minded individuals and face the challenges together. From hardened criminals built like mountains or scientists with a shady past, there’s a host of different potential companions to journey with, each replete with their own unique personality and skills. Or you can just go “Lone Wolf” and face everything alone; it’s not an easy road but you can play this way too if you so wish.Encased is full of choices: from what sort of character you will be, what wing you will join and how honourable a person you are. What equipment do you take? How will you fight? Do you craft better weapons or armour? And it doesn’t stop there. You will hold lives in the balance and will have to choose who survives and who perishes. And every decision you make will impact the story and your gaming experience. Well, no one said surviving Armageddon was going to be easy…",

While most humans were unable to escape the planet before the missiles fell, small pockets of humanity had spread to most of the solar system and a handful of survivors kept trying to hold humanity together. The game takes place almost three centuries after the final war on Earth. The AI production facilities were all destroyed in the nuclear fire, but some of their troops survived and are holed up on the dark edges of the solar system.However, survival isn't easy. Food is always in short supply, and filtering and harvesting water takes precious energy. What was left of the military forces united to form the Inter-Planetary Defense Force (IPDF). Their mission is mainly to serve as peacekeepers resolve disputes, and protect settlers from bandits who would steal supplies by force. What makes people human is quickly fading in the face of famines, murder, and constant threat from the remaining AI forces.GAMEPLAYDissolution has both FPS and space vehicle in gameplay. The gameplay that we’re aiming for is immersive and intense, in both the in-game economy and combat. Dissolution is a living game, which means every action you take in the game will have real consequences. Something as simple as mining and selling ore will have a butterfly effect in the world: ore prices will decrease, factories would get cheaper to run, and eventually even the price of goods drop.Meanwhile, if you attack a trading route as a pirate cutting off the supply route of the same ore, it would have the opposite effect. We will allow players a great deal of freedom and personal choice in how they play the game. You'll be able to purchase properties, vehicles, weapons, trade stocks and bonds, and get involved in a free-floating economy where prices are decided by supply and demand. You could be a pacifist and not even own a firearm, or become a ruthless pirate pillaging supply ships and leaving no survivors. A marketplace will allow free trading to take place between players.DEVELOPMENTOur team is composed of four very dedicated game developers who want to create a different take on space MMO games. We are currently about a year and a half into development, and are planning for the game to hit 1.0 release before 2022.

        "About the Game": "DISCLAIMERIf you’ve come to experience a clean, polished, AAA game, this game (in its current state) is not for you. If you're interested in being a part of a game with a dedicated dev team, seeing progress and helping guide the game's development, you're in the right place!The current project is in ALPHA and does NOT represent the quality of the final product. With your help and patience, we are currently testing for bugs, glitches and multiplayer performance. You will experience errors, crashes and unfinished features during your playtime. Please report bugs to our steam Bug Reports thread or our Discord. We will try to roll out updates as quickly as possible. Join our  community to help report bugs and request features.BACKSTORYIn the world of Dissolution, the Earth has been destroyed by weapons of mass destruction in a desperate attempt to halt the AI advance that had taken over most of the planet. While most humans were unable to escape the planet before the missiles fell, small pockets of humanity had spread to most of the solar system and a handful of survivors kept trying to hold humanity together.

He soon discovers a secret room that he never noticed when he was younger, and neither did his uncle. In it contains three life-like dolls who he accidentally awakens.

        "Detailed Description": "New release from GameNetGameNet Publisher is excited to announce a new game, that is already available on Steam!About the GameA Deck-Building RoguelikeWith Destiny or Fate, we tried to create a balanced combination of two popular genres: deck-building games and roguelikes. You can choose the tactics that best suit your playstyle: you can fight bosses or go on a treasure hunt; you can battle amazing creatures and either defeat them or recruit them into to your party. But be careful — if your hero dies in the middle of an adventure, you’ll have to start all over again!A Variety of Heroes with Unique AbilitiesEach time the game begins, you set out on a journey with one of the heroes you've unlocked. You unlock new heroes as you advance in the game. Each hero has their own special abilities that can be enhanced. Some heroes have powerful attack skills, while others are responsible for keeping your party’s defenses up.In Destiny or Fate, heroes cannot be “controlled directly.” However, the player can use a hero’s unique skills each time they play a certain combination of cards. The tactics you use during card battles will thus vary dramatically depending on your hero. Heroes also have passive skills that don't need to be activated.Each character in the game has their own backstory that is reflected in their personality and abilities.Strategically Build Your Own PartyExcluding bosses, each and every monster you encounter during your adventure can be recruited to your party. Recruit monsters with skills that have caused you trouble so you can do the same thing to the next opponent you meet in battle. As with heroes, you can upgrade your monsters' skills by collecting treasure.With your unique deck of cards, your hero, and the monsters you defeat over the course of the game, you can form a party that's tailored to your individual playstyle. Needless to say, achieving that perfect combination is no small feat! For that to happen, you will need a lot of hard work... and a little luck.Main Game FeaturesMore than 15 different heroes with unique abilities. More than 150 cards for heroes and monsters.More than 100 types of monsters.5 chapters that are different every time you play.An increasing number of heroes and cards as the rounds progress.The ability to capture all monsters (except bosses) to use as companions in battle.",

        "Detailed Description": "In Final Upgrade, you will experience the role of artificial intelligence (AI), created by mankind to help spread colonists across the galaxy.In each game session, you are tasked with conquering one of the regions of the galaxy. Arriving at the site with one ship carrying minimal resources, you must build a massive factory spread over 100 sectors, producing all sorts of resources that the colonists might need.Use various construction tools.In addition to the classic build mode through the objects panel, the player has the option to use the quick build mode, which allows you to install fully connected machines or even an entire production chain in a few clicks.Any segment can be saved to a module for later unlimited use.Design unique ships and stations.The player can use the built-in blueprints for stations and ships, create their own unique blueprints, or download blueprints created by others from the Steam workshop.Automate resource flows.The player can both perform many tasks manually, and automate them there by running one of the auto-logic on controlled ships and stations. Here are some of them: transporter, builder, miner, energy carrier, ammunition carrier, warship.Create complex supply chains.There are three main ways to build a logistics system: routes, a network of teleportation relays, and auto-logic waypoints for direct docking of ships and stations.Terraform planets.For population growth, each habitable planet requires a supply of a certain type of resource. When a planet reaches its population limit, the colonists request some resources to terraform the planet.Unlock technologies.As it develops, the AI becomes able to unlock and use more and more advanced technologies (over 150). AI data placement requires memory, which is provided by colonists for certain achievements (capturing new sectors, increasing the level of planets, reaching global population marks.Conquer the galaxy for humanity.Part of the planets is under the control of mechanical factions of old, dead civilizations. To free the territory, you need to open various combat technologies (weapons and armor). Different metal alloys have different resistances to certain types of damage. In the later stages of the game, the technology for the production of living metals becomes available, regenerating upon taking damage. They can also be combined into an alloy for even more damage resistance.Customize the game.At the beginning of the game, there are many options available for every taste. Many features can be enabled and disabled for a unique gaming experience. For example, a peaceful mode in which there are no enemies.Starting from very simple settings where the game is fast paced and relatively easy to achieve, the player can progress to higher difficulty levels where every choice counts, and every opportunity must be used to move forward.So, let's get our Final Upgrade now!",

        "Detailed Description": "What The Mortals ThinkAbout the GameFelix The Reaper is a challenging single-player puzzle game. You take on the role as Felix, whose job is to make sure that people die. To do this, Felix must work in the shadows and rearrange faith so that death is always the end result.At its core, the game is about manipulating shadows so that Felix can set up his targets safely covered by the shadows. The core gameplay has a Hitman Go'ish, Monument Valley'ing and Sokoban-like simplicity running through it.There are three rules you have to master to become a successful Reaper:Rule #1: Stick to the shadowsEach level is set on a grid-based platform. The squares of the grid are either lit up or in shadow, and Felix has to do his job in the shadows.Rule #2: Control the shadowsFelix has the ability to rotate the sun, and move objects, to create new pathways for him to reach his target.Rule #3: Make sure people dieThe end goal of each level is to set up your targets and have them meet their maker.To add something extra to this core game experience, we wrapped it in deep layers of storytelling, death, dance, art history, love and comedy. That way you get to enjoy a wholesome story world, while boiling your brains on complicatedly straight forward shadow puzzles about Death.Challenging single-player puzzle game.Take on the job as The Reaper and make sure people die.Make sure to stay in the shadows. Light is the domain of life. Not good.Control the shadows to reach your target.Enjoy a framing narrative of dangerous love and peculiar characters.Dance along with Felix to an original soundtrack from 10+ indie music artists.Unlock time trials and hardcore levels for an extra challenge.Felix The Reaper sprang from a fascination with the sprawling, humorous and grotesque art history of Death. Many themes have emerged in the cultural identity of Death, including The Dance of Death or Danse Macabre and Death And The Maiden. We sort of mashed those two themes together in Felix The Reaper. For the character himself and the world around him, the inspiration was more diverse: We took cues from the ancient TV show The Twilight Zone, medieval painters like Bruegel and Bosch and the cartoon characters of Adventure Time and Hayao Miyazaki. Another important inspiration for Felix The Reaper was the amazing artistic collaborators in the production. We worked with dancers, a long list of music artists and history scholars.The DanceSeveral dancers contributed to the game's production, and eventually Gunilla Lind and Raphaël Ferdinand Eder-Kastling improvised the final moves that ended up in the game. Here's Gunilla doing a dance move for Felix:And here's Raphael doing another:The MusicOf course a game with a dancing protagonist needs great music—why else would he be dancing? We designed the game in a way that lets the music artists be themselves. We wanted them to add to the game through their personal artistic expression, rather than ask them to be what we want them to be. This made for a varied and strange combination of music. But since the gameplay is a non-stressful puzzler, you actually have time to appreciate and enjoy the weirdness while playing.The Art HistoryThe idea for the game itself stems from art history. We actually started with The Danse Macabre and Death and The Maiden as a basis, and then asked ourselves: How can we make a game about this? Eventually and through several different prototypes, we ended up here.  Alongside the production, a history scholar was diving into the art history of Death across more than 10 centuries for a book manuscript he is working on, and every time he hit upon something interesting he told us, and we tried to put it into the game if it fit. There are five different articles by this historian Søren Hein Rasmussen within the game—you can unlock them as you progress.",

        "Detailed Description": "A simple world where the player is able to change things that are not supposed to be changed. Welcome to Curiosity, the game where you can hack. Try out different hacks, get creative, entertain yourself! And hey, maybe you'll find a secret or two along the way!This is an infinite platformer with horizontal player movement. When the game is started, two tabs open: one with the platformer itself, and one that appears to be a command prompt. A narrator starts speaking, and quickly notes that the platformer seems to be dull and uninteresting. He then tutorials the player on how to &quot;hack&quot;. &quot;Hacking&quot; gives the ability to change important variables in the code and to enable things that affect the environment.As the narrator will explain, to &quot;hack&quot;, the player must press the &quot;h&quot; key while the platformer tab is selected. The platformer will then freeze as it waits for input from the hacking tab (the one that looks like a command prompt). The player then must switch to the command prompt, type in a &quot;hack&quot;, and press enter. They will then be prompted to enter an integer (numbers), string (words), or boolean (true/false) to complete the hack. After completing the hack, the player can go back to the platformer to see what changed.Here's an example of what happens in the hacking tab with a player doubling their speed:-------------------Enter Hack: speed-------------------Speed Hack:-------------------Variable Type: IntegerDefault State: 6Current State: 6-------------------Enter new speed: 12Hack Successful!-------------------Hacking process completeGo back to the game-------------------The game encourages using trial and error to see what each hack does (and using the hack &quot;list&quot; to see which hacks exist), but here's what they do if you don't want to test them out for yourself:&quot;ascend&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, platforms rise into the sky whenever the player steps on them.&quot;birdNumber&quot; - Enter an integer. Affects the maximum amount of birds the player can spawn.&quot;birdPoop&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, birds will occasionally drop bird poop.&quot;birdPoopRate&quot; - Enter an integer. Affects the rate at which birds can drop poop (&quot;birdPoop&quot; must be enabled to see this change).&quot;birdSpeed&quot; - Enter an integer. Affects the speed at which the birds fly.&quot;blackhole&quot; - Enter a boolean. Enables a blackhole that sucks in all sprites and the player's mouse. The game warns you to have caution, since it will take control of your mouse while this hack is enabled.&quot;clearScreen&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, the command prompt is cleared.&quot;clone&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, clones of the player can be created by pressing the space bar.&quot;color&quot; - Enter three integers, as instructed. Affects the background color of the sky.&quot;deathTouch&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, the player destroys whatever they touch.&quot;fly&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, the player can fly.&quot;gravity&quot; - Enter an integer. Affects the strength of the game's gravity.&quot;jump&quot; - Enter an integer. Affects the player's jump height.&quot;language&quot; - Enter a string as prompted. Changes the language of the words &quot;Dull Platformer&quot; at the top of the tab, and of the &quot;Ouch&quot; said by sprites when they crash their heads into platforms.&quot;list&quot; - Shows this list of hacks. Does not show the hack &quot;secret&quot;.&quot;morph&quot; - Enter a string as prompted. Changes the player into other sprites in the game. Your hit-box and abilities are updated accordingly.&quot;mousePlay&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, the player becomes your mouse, and the game attempts to give your mouse collision detection. As with the hack &quot;blackhole&quot;, the game cautions you that this hack will take control of your mouse.&quot;multiplayer&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, a second player can join by playing on the same keyboard as instructed.&quot;music&quot; - Enter a string as prompted. Allows players to change the sounds of the game to a song, silence, or the tutorial again.&quot;secret&quot; - Enter a boolean. When enabled, the birds and flowers get sunglasses.&quot;speed&quot; - Enter an integer. Affects the speed of the player.&quot;weather&quot; - Enter a string as prompted. Changes the weather of the platformer.As players experiment with different hacks, 5 pieces of a key can be found. When the player finds all 5 pieces, the narrator comes back to speak to you and the ending is unlocked.",

        "Detailed Description": "You are a part of Project GR-5LYR: Galactic Relocation. Our home planet, Earth, is running out of resources, so we must find a new place to call home. Your mission is to land on an unexplored Earth-like planet, codenamed 5LYR, and prepare it for human habitation. You must start and expand a colony and use your resources wisely, while clearing the planet of any hostile local lifeforms and defending your base from attack.In the beginning, you start by placing your Colony Core, the center of your new colony. The Core produces new building types, represented as cards that you can place onto the map using Energy. Different buildings have different roles, such as improving vision range, producing or housing new units, attacking events or defending your buildings, or generating more Energy to be able to play more per turn.As you expand your base, upgrade your buildings, and subdue hostiles, you'll gain access to more unit types, and upgrades to your buildings and soldiers. When your new colony is properly established, you'll have to find a way to contact Earth's people and give them the signal that it's safe to arrive.Project GR-5LYR: Galactic Relocation features a unique combination of turn-based strategy and deck-building mechanics, mixed with tactical turn-based combat. Will you succeed in saving Earth's people, or will the mission be a failure? It's up to you!A small team of four people got together and worked feverishly for one month to make this game. All planning, design, art, and coding was done in just 31 days. We worked shoulder-to-shoulder, late into the night, to make the game as good as it can be, and we're very proud of the results of this effort.

Start a colony and use your resources wisely on the world map, and &quot;take care&quot; of any hostile local lifeforms in tactical turn-based combat.",
        "About the Game": "You are a part of Project GR-5LYR: Galactic Relocation. Our home planet, Earth, is running out of resources, so we must find a new place to call home. Your mission is to land on an unexplored Earth-like planet, codenamed 5LYR, and prepare it for human habitation. You must start and expand a colony and use your resources wisely, while clearing the planet of any hostile local lifeforms and defending your base from attack.In the beginning, you start by placing your Colony Core, the center of your new colony. The Core produces new building types, represented as cards that you can place onto the map using Energy. Different buildings have different roles, such as improving vision range, producing or housing new units, attacking events or defending your buildings, or generating more Energy to be able to play more per turn.As you expand your base, upgrade your buildings, and subdue hostiles, you'll gain access to more unit types, and upgrades to your buildings and soldiers. When your new colony is properly established, you'll have to find a way to contact Earth's people and give them the signal that it's safe to arrive.Project GR-5LYR: Galactic Relocation features a unique combination of turn-based strategy and deck-building mechanics, mixed with tactical turn-based combat. Will you succeed in saving Earth's people, or will the mission be a failure? It's up to you!A small team of four people got together and worked feverishly for one month to make this game. All planning, design, art, and coding was done in just 31 days. We worked shoulder-to-shoulder, late into the night, to make the game as good as it can be, and we're very proud of the results of this effort. We hope you like the game.NOTE: This game does not run on Windows 7 or earlier.",

        "Detailed Description": "LEMURIA is a 3rd-person shooter adventure game with numerous cutscenes and dialog, set against the backdrop of massive street riots and the beginning of a deadly epidemic. When connecting the Fantasy Chapter DLC at the very end, the player will also have to travel through the magical jungles of Illusory Reality in a fantasy setting.Guns, girls, cars, gold, uranium and wads of money - well, what else? Maybe an SSD-drive full of stolen digital koins? No? Well then the ultimate prize is to get out of it all alive! When civilization begins to collapse and its laws cease to apply, all the problems that arise have to be solved by violence.Main CharactersThe game's protagonists - unemployed veteran Alex[/i] and hapless spy Kanta Anora - begin their journey to the African country of Lemuria, each for their own reason, each from their own end of the world, each in their own way. Who they will become - friends, enemies, lovers - time will tell. This is the first part of their adventures.Alex on the way to his dream will have to use the skills received in the army more than once, and Kanta is able to arrange (and most likely will arrange) armageddon when performing any, even the simplest task.MusicThe game uses music by Chris Onyak and John Leonard French. Even if these names are unknown to you, you've probably heard their music in other games. A special mixing system allows the musical background to seamlessly adjust to changes in gameplay.AIAI NPCs are able to advance, retreat, shoot from cover, search for medical kits and ammunition, join groups and scatter in different directions, overcome obstacles and wait out of the enemy's line of sight. And all this without pre-made triggers, which makes each battle unique and replayable.CustomizabilityThe game has a large number of customizable parameters, let's focus on just a few.You can independently customize the duration and intensity of firefights, the degree of protection of the Player and the strength of the weapon, or simply choose a set of settings from pre-made presets.With a couple of clicks in the settings, the game's visuals can be changed from prim melodrama for the whole family to shamelessly unbridled VHS action movie of the 80s.The rigidity of the image on the screen can vary from crisp TV camera to soft movie film. Camera speed and inertia can be changed even during gameplay by going to the Main Menu.BalanceThe player can adjust both the ratio of time of shootings to the time of dialogs, and the complexity of these shootings, according to his preferences. It should be noted that in any case, tactical decisions will be more important than marksmanship. It is also important to know that this game does not encourage camping and fights against it by increasing visibility and damage. The gameplay is made as varied as possible, and in each new location the player will most likely have to find new tactics. With the right settings, the game will move on to the next stage before getting bored with the current stage.If you like fantasy setting, don't forget to connect Fantasy Chapter DLC at once, so that you won't have to look for the entry point to it later. This DLC recounts the events after the consciousnesses of Kanta and the prisoner were placed in virtual reality.The Halloween DLC adds pumpkin monsters to the Dark Side of the Sun chapter, capable of suddenly ruining all your carefully planned stealth. It's unrealistic, but it might be fun for some.ConclusionIn addition to uncompromising firefights and saving the next “demoiselle en détresse”, the player is treated to a fair amount of stealth and engaging dialog. This game is a neat diversion for a few evenings, giving you a chance to shoot, talk, wander around the magical jungle and maybe do something else...",

But the Grail is hidden deep into a dangerous place, where all men are gay and women have hair under their arms: the Kingdom of France!Lancelot's Hangover is a 3-to-6-hour-long retro point &amp; click adventure game with very silly humour.

WOW! And even sexier lepers and witches to be burned at the stake yelling weather forecasts!... and many, many, many more serious characters!Is it true that Lancelot's Hangover is officially considered as &quot;silly and unsuitable for the youth&quot; by European Union justice?Yes, you are correct!Indeed, the European Commercial Court of Justice (ECCJ), held on 6th January 2020 in Brussels (Belgium), stated that: The author of the video game called “Lancelot’s Hangover: The Quest for the Holy Booze” is no more allowed to include in his playful-oriented computer program any puzzles that can be solved in a logical manner. The player, to progress through the game, must always use, one by one, all the objects in the inventory on all the different objects and characters within the game (and if possible, several times). In addition, only websites in the Serbo-Croatian language will be willing to publish a text walkthrough (which must first be encrypted using the SHA-512 algorithm).  The author of the video game “Lancelot’s Hangover: The Quest for the Holy Booze” will also break any contacts with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un by 23rd June 2026 and will provide a urine sample, every Tuesday morning, at The European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) until January 1st 2027.",

WOW! And even sexier lepers and witches to be burned at the stake yelling weather forecasts!... and many, many, many more serious characters!Is it true that Lancelot's Hangover is officially considered as &quot;silly and unsuitable for the youth&quot; by European Union justice?Yes, you are correct!Indeed, the European Commercial Court of Justice (ECCJ), held on 6th January 2020 in Brussels (Belgium), stated that: The author of the video game called “Lancelot’s Hangover: The Quest for the Holy Booze” is no more allowed to include in his playful-oriented computer program any puzzles that can be solved in a logical manner. The player, to progress through the game, must always use, one by one, all the objects in the inventory on all the different objects and characters within the game (and if possible, several times). In addition, only websites in the Serbo-Croatian language will be willing to publish a text walkthrough (which must first be encrypted using the SHA-512 algorithm).  The author of the video game “Lancelot’s Hangover: The Quest for the Holy Booze” will also break any contacts with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un by 23rd June 2026 and will provide a urine sample, every Tuesday morning, at The European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) until January 1st 2027.",

        "Detailed Description": "Duck Casino is a casual shooting game, in which player is a traveler passing a casino. This casino is very strange. It doesn't gamble with money, but the duck. In every game, one who shots more ducks is the winner.\r\n\r\nThe game rules seem simple, but vice versus in fact. The whole shooting process is with a certain degree of simulation, featuring recoil reduction, scope drift, stamina, physical strength.\r\n\r\nDucks will not be sitting ones, and they will fight back against intruders entering the farm. There are several kinds of ducks, each of which has its own characteristics. Some are good at throwing stones at players remotely, while some are good at attacking with paws within a close range, and it is more likely to appear strong ghost ducks at night.\r\n\r\nAnd the player is not an onlooker who only needs to click the mouse. When a group of ducks attack you, the player must keep moving to avoid the attack, which means that moving will cause more shaking and it is more difficult to aim at the target.\r\n\r\nTo get the highest score, it is no harm that the COMBO is high, and if NiceShot is triggered by some conditions, you can get multiple scores and play different ways.\r\n\r\nHowever, relying on technology is not enough. Don't forget that this is a gamble. Maybe your opponent is lucky enough to hit a very high score, which you have no way to deal with.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n-Three modes &amp; playing methods: Gamble mode, Heavy machine gun mode, Duck hunt mode\r\n-All the weapons can be upgraded\r\n-Shooting close-up\r\n-Although there are not many props, they can provide various aids to adapt to various kinds of play\r\n-COMBO &amp; NiceShot\r\n-There exist scenes of day and night. The night scene is darker, and you need to use flashlight\r\n-In your spare time, you can catch some small animals in the scene\r\n-Magically refitted heavy machine guns\r\n-Unlimited ducks, enjoy shooting\r\n\r\n\r\n———— The game will add other modes in the future, please look forward to it!",

        "Detailed Description": "Fatal Hour: Petroleum is the first chapter of the Fatal Hour Saga.The SituationTwo words: Zombie ApocalypseYour team of survivors have acquired transportation in the form of a bus and are seeking the source of an automated radio transmission, in the hopes of finding other people. Living people that is, there is an abundance of the other kind.Traveling through the barren wastelands, the engine starts coughing. You manage to make it to what appears to be an abandoned gas station, in the middle of nowhere. Fortunately, a member of your group, Mechanic Mike, figures he can fix the engine and get you back on the road. He's no magician though and will need some time. Time, however, might just prove to be in short supply, since your arrival at the gas station has been registered by what used to be the living residents of the area and the likewise formerly living inmates of the nearby female penitentiary.They may be no longer living, but one thing is sure: They're HUNGRY!The GameGameplayFatal Hour: Petroleum is an explosive, non-stop action packed, single map, top-down, 3:rd person, zombie survival, RTS, Tower Defense hybrid. Yes, you got it right, now try saying it out loud. You command a team of 5 characters with different personalities and preferred weaponry. You're stranded and surrounded by hordes of undead whose dinner is long overdue. To put it plainly, your mission is simple: SURVIVE BY ANY MEANS POSSIBLE.The Chapter SystemFatal Hour: Petroleum is the first in a series of stand alone chapter games that tell the story of a group of people, struggling to survive in the aftermath of the Zombie Apocalypse. Each chapter is a single-level minigame, played as a separate challenge available at different levels of difficulty. The goal is to achieve the best possible result and survive as long as possible. In the first chapter, the group is stranded at an abandoned gas station, struggling to keep the undead at bay while they repair their transportation.The chapter games will be released in quick succession, with just a few weeks in between. At least three chapter minigames are planned for release, after which a decision will be made either to continue with additional game chapters or create a larger and more diverse game, with strategic as well as tactical game elements. This decision will be heavily influenced by player opinions.The GroupPrepper JackMost people of the Earth were caught completely unprepared by the sudden events of what came to be known as &quot;The Outbreak&quot;. This guy was not. Some people would even say that he was so prepared for the Apocalypse that he was actually happy when it finally happened. Armed with a military grade precision sniper rifle and the eyes of an unrivalled marksman, Prepper Jack could probably hit a fly on a wall from a mile away. However, most flies these days are not on walls and should he miss the occasional flying bug, chances are that his shot will still have the desired effect on the undead thing it was sitting on. Prepper JackTrailer JaneTrailer Jane was working late on the day of The Outbreak. When the hordes reached the diner, the young waitress was the only survivor, thanks to the Colt 1911 - a present from her father on her 9:th birthday - that she never left out of reach even before the end of the world. What really ticked her off was when one of the undead managed to mess up her hair on the same day as she had been to the salon. The killing spree that followed is said to have made even the undead sick to their stomach and chances are that some of the corpses she left behind in the diner wasn't really dead to begin with. But don't even hint about that to Jane if you know what's good for you. Anyway, since the trailer park that had been Jane's home since birth was completely overrun by the hordes, Jane has made it her mission in life to kill again what is already dead. Trailer JaneDeputy KlausWhen the hordes descended on Dirtmine, Arizona, Deputy Klaus was busy, escorting an undesired bum out of town and &quot;mildly persuading&quot; him never to return. As Klaus came back to the sheriff's office, no one appeared to be left alive. A few minutes later, Klaus had made sure that no one was left moving as well. Some people say that there actually was a survivor, a local man that spent every other night in lockup due to a habit involving drinking, fighting and... well mainly drinking and fighting. Since Klaus was a firm believer in the value of teaching lessons, it is not unlikely that if so, Klaus may have just left him in his cell awaiting the sheriff's order to release the prisoner, as regulations stated. At least if there was nothing in the regulations about making exceptions in case the sheriff was no longer able to issue such an order due to being busy prowling the streets with an urge to devour human flesh. Deputy KlausSamu JinA tech student who really didn't bother to hang out with anyone else, Jin spent most of his time prior to The Outbreak studying or practicing with the ancient sword replica he purchased on eBuy. Most people around him thought him fairly strange, and the word &quot;creepy&quot; was more often than not used by people describing him to others. As The Outbreak came, Jin was convinced that it was caused by something in the air, perhaps something to do with chemtrails. Although there's been no proof of such a connection since, Jin retains his conviction about the state of the matter and prefers to keep his gas mask on at all times. Well, he actually takes it off from time to time for eating and drinking, but generally tries to hold his breath as best as possible during those rare occasions. So far, he's turned down all opportunities to switch out his sword for a ranged weapon and seems to prefer going all out berserk when confronted with the undead. Samu JinShotgun JoeNo one really knows muck about what Shotgun Joe did before The Outbreak, but he seems to regard the undead as mostly a nuisance that has to be put down with much the same focus as a buzzing mosquito has to be waved away. A sawed off shotgun is his weapon of choice, some say because he cannot be bothered to have to aim to hit his target. Having to raise his weapon to aim would probably piss him off quite badly. In fact, Joe is pissed off by a lot of things but mostly by people, especially the kind that bother him with talking. The jury's out on whether Joe actually likes living, talking people or undead the least. But at least he can kill the undead kind without anyone complaining, which seems to suit him just fine. Shotgun JoeMechanic MikeGrowing up Mechanic Mike was not the brightest kid in town. In fact, he was probably just about the opposite. By the age of 12, he had just learned the basics of reading and to be honest he didn't really get any further than that. He never spoke much and he easily got confused when people talked fast or used difficult words. You might expect a kid like that to get bullied badly by the other kids, and it might have happened to Mike as well, had it not been for one reason: He was simply huge. A head above other kids his age and about twice as wide. Most of all he reminded you of a bull, both physically and intellectually. No kid would run the risk of provoking him, even though he really never got into a fight or hit someone. Living alone with his widowed mother, he preferred to spend his time in the garage, playing with his late father's tools and old car. Mike failed miserably at school and didn't appear to be able to learn anything at all above the level of a 6-year-old. Except for one thing. He had an amazing understanding of engines and mechanics, far beyond what anyone could expect of a professional mechanic or engineer. As his mother was one of the first victims on The Outbreak, Mike ran from town. An almost unbelievably peaceful person, he couldn't bring himself to use force even against the undead hordes, not even to save his own life. Lucky for him, he came across a group of individuals with more than plenty of potential for violence, but in desperate need of a mechanic. Mechanic Mike",

The game comprises six levels and you must escape each successive area in order to progress through the story. You will enlist the help of some old friends to help along the way and, hopefully, uncover your own path.Some Level Themes:Aftermath: Revel in the destruction of days past. Contemplate your actions or inaction.The Church of Kitsch: Escape the confines of a rigid structure. Visit the church and pay respects. Art and Commerce: Visit the opportunity hub in order to generate some currency, attend the learning annex, and apply to exhibit at Art Basil Minneapolis. Keep an eye on your relevance though, you will need it.Art and Celebrity: Visit a mystical land where you will learn how to become an art star. Create your own personal mythology and acquire currency from collectors. Be careful though, you might lose yourself.Redemption: Re-visit the past and connect with your roots. Excavate. The Road Home: Escape the final structure and light four beacons in order to finish the game. Easter Eggs:There are multiple easter eggs and hidden areas in the game. Some achievements are unlocked by finding these areas.Mouse and Keyboard Controls:WASD to move forward, backward, and side to side.HOLD LEFT SHIFT and any movement key (WASD) in order to sprint.SPACE BAR to jump.E to interact with some objects.RIGHT MOUSE CLICK to pick up some objects.

It does not save location data or incremental progress (other than the beacon info). If you quit the game in the middle of a level you will need to start over when you reload it (other than the last level).Note from the dev:This game was created over a year from November 2017 through November 2018. It was a very personal project that deals with my struggles navigating the pitfalls of the art world and my realizations and epiphanies regarding the complex systems within that world.

Dash, shoot, and teleport around unique arenas that feature impossible geometry where there is no right side up and death can come from any direction. You’d better bring your A game and telefrag your enemies into oblivion if you want to excel in PvP duels.Set in an alternative universe where the Roman Empire never collapsed, you step into the shoes of a new breed of a gladiator on the road to becoming a champion. Use your speed, accuracy, and wits to outmaneuver and defeat your enemies, crushing them beneath your feet.Loadout Management – Pick your favorite loadout to outwit your enemy. Combine powerful firearms to create the most powerful set. Each weapon features two firing modes and a unique teleportation attack.Teleport Attacks and Telefrags – Use teleport to move through the play space or telefrag your enemy! See them reduced to a pulp, using the well-known ability.Guns – Pick the best one, including classic arena shooter weapons, such as Rocket Launchers and Flak Cannons, as well as futuristic Plasma Rifles.Fast-Paced Matches – You have two different locomotion types at your disposal. Get comfortable with dash movement or experience, why gladiatorial battles are reserved for the most persistent ones in the free locomotion.Impossible spaces – Fight in unique arenas arranged with no regard for gravity, opening up various angles of attack and movement. The designed maps will force you to be on guard.Arena Game Mode – Fight in 1v1 deathmatches on the principle of rounds. Climb up the leaderboards and conquer the most significant win streak.The Empire has never forgotten about their beliefs and traditions, including gladiatorial battles, which have now become the most prestigious sport in the sprawling intergalactic Empire. You can play 1v1 deathmatches in a best-of-five rounds format to determine the ultimate victor. As for futuristic gladiators, there is no place for losers. Wager your hard-earned loadouts and try to stay alive for as many matches as possible to make your mark in the global leaderboards.PvP matches will require a good knowledge of the arenas in addition to creative use of dashes and teleports to gain the upper hand in combat. But these abilities are for more than just defense and evasion – after all, the game is called Telefrag. Tired of shooting or in the middle of reloading? No problem, teleport through your enemies to watch as they’re reduced to a pulp. The game’s abstract arenas will test your skills. Move dynamically through the designed maps and don't stay in one place under any circumstances.Shoot your opponents with a range of firearms, from the staples of the genre to new, unique entries. But if you’re going to outwit your enemies, you’ll need to choose your loadouts carefully! Some may work better against your opponent than others. Each weapon also has a unique, built-in teleportation attack that is more than just a means of locomotion. Prove that in this prestigious sport you have something to say. Put on VR goggles and immerse yourself in the futuristic times of the Great Empire!",

        "Detailed Description": "Welcome to the wonderful world of Rascals, the VR board game where you take first person control of your pieces to play dirty tricks on the opposition. It plays much like any other board game where you throw dice to move your pieces along a path from Start to Goal, until you sneak up behind one of your friends and shoot him in the back of the head. If that doesn't sound like fun, you can always crush him with a rolling boulder, or just blow him right off the board. If just racing all your pieces to Goal isn't enough, you can try your hand at quicker game modes like racing a single piece to goal, Hold the Fort in which you must control the Goal area to score points, or Last Man Standing where you simply have to survive.You will be doing battle against a varied bunch of AI personalities, with different skill sets and tactical preferences setting their play styles apart. To help you gain an edge you have access to a wide array of weaponry, ranging from rocks and guns, through explosive bananas and dynamite, to Ninja Whale attacks and insidious arrows that keep hurting your victim until he can afford to remove it. The Rascals themselves are both cute and creepy, the perfect victims of your acts of violence, lovingly crafted from exotic wood in a world of marble and granite.FeaturesSingle player career mode with 60 missions8 distinct AI personalities15 weapons and powerups20 levelsHot seat multiplayer supportR/C toys and other distractions for when someone else is taking his turn",

        "About the Game": "Welcome to the wonderful world of Rascals, the VR board game where you take first person control of your pieces to play dirty tricks on the opposition. It plays much like any other board game where you throw dice to move your pieces along a path from Start to Goal, until you sneak up behind one of your friends and shoot him in the back of the head. If that doesn't sound like fun, you can always crush him with a rolling boulder, or just blow him right off the board. If just racing all your pieces to Goal isn't enough, you can try your hand at quicker game modes like racing a single piece to goal, Hold the Fort in which you must control the Goal area to score points, or Last Man Standing where you simply have to survive.You will be doing battle against a varied bunch of AI personalities, with different skill sets and tactical preferences setting their play styles apart. To help you gain an edge you have access to a wide array of weaponry, ranging from rocks and guns, through explosive bananas and dynamite, to Ninja Whale attacks and insidious arrows that keep hurting your victim until he can afford to remove it. The Rascals themselves are both cute and creepy, the perfect victims of your acts of violence, lovingly crafted from exotic wood in a world of marble and granite.FeaturesSingle player career mode with 60 missions8 distinct AI personalities15 weapons and powerups20 levelsHot seat multiplayer supportR/C toys and other distractions for when someone else is taking his turn",

Play both Ghost and Hunter in a chaotic 4v4 struggle between the living and the dead.TONGUE-IN-CHEEK HIDE-AND-SEEKAs a Ghost, conceal yourself inside seemingly harmless pieces of furniture to evade preying Hunters… but when their backs are turned, turn the environment against them with telekinetic bombardment. No chair, lamp, or grandfather clock is innocent in this hijinks-heavy frenzy.MIDNIGHT MAYHEMThe fun isn’t over yet...when the clock strikes twelve, the witching hour begins, and the Hunters become the Hunted. The tables turn and Ghosts become supercharged, giving Hunters a limited amount of time to survive their vengeful wrath.MURDEROUS 4v4 MULTIPLAYERPlay together and communicate with your team and ensure a triumphant victory, giving each other pointers on the paths enemies tend to tread. Create synergies with your team's abilities to outthink and outwit your opponents.HARNESS SUPERNATURAL ABILITIESThe restrictions of reality don’t apply to Ghosts, of course. Claim your supernatural powers, which include turning invisible, causing furniture to float, and conjuring a dangerous Ghostly miasma.

Choose from an extra burst of speed, health-replenishing capabilities and a host of other powers to get ahead of the game.A BEVY OF BLOOD-CURDLING MAPS Explore ten unsettling locations, including an abandoned theatre, eerie mansion and cursed carnival.

        "Detailed Description": "In the early 2000s there was this game, called &quot;Johnny Megatone&quot;.I used to play it on the television, and it made my infancy.In 2011, Johnny disappeared from my country and it's been since then that I haven't been able to give it a taste again.For some nostalgia reasons I guess, I long longed to propose something similar for the pc universe. Something like Johnny!I also wanted my game to feel like a tribute to the original, since I miss it so much!There were 6 arches in the authentic game and mine covers the first, settled in a forest and other beautiful places.To sell without copyright problems, the whole artistic side of the project was made completely by me using Photoshop.Some backgrounds and sounds were obtained from the internet, but always copyright-free.Scripting was also developed by me as well as the choice of the game engine.Characteristics- There is no possibility to save. This is because I wanted to mantain a certain extent of atmosphere that also the original had (In fact I couldn't save there!);- On the other hand, this game can be completed in 2 hours if you never lose and are either talented or lucky;- Movement system is choppy and kinda slow. Again, I did that on purpose because I really enjoyed it back then in Johnny;- It is not said that a scenario change leads to a more hostic gameplay. It might be, but that's not 100% assured;- There are some interesting secret passages you might want to find and delve deeply into;- You'll have a pistol with 6 projectiles and 6 bombs that are needed to go on and survive; you can find supplies for them during the course;- Enemies respawn if you go back and forth through each screen; keep that in mind and don't waste your inventory;- Learning the movement system might take a few tries: it's not easy to get into it and might annoy at first. Don't give up!- You'll start your adventure with 10 lives. To increase your chances of surviving, gather up 1000 points to obtain one extra life point;- Avoid traps, choose right timings, kill enemies, crouch when needed, detonate bombs to destroy unstable dirt, climb ladders and use moving platforms to go on!- I reckon this game will be great for the ones who are curious!",

Which, to clarify, are absolutely regular-sized.Key Features Play through a charming comedy-noir storyline inspired by every cat ever, with fewer cat puns than you might expurrct.

We've been playing them for decades, and we love them - so we're making one. Combining our favourite elements of everything that came before, we hope to mix it up into something deeply entertaining.While we've drawn on film noir for the story's inspiration, we're leaning much more towards the comedy side of &quot;comedy-noir&quot;. Expect some serious topics, addressed seriously - but we don't want to burden the whole game down under the weight of unrelenting grittiness. We feel that there's enough of that in the world already.Fun comes first, and we aim to be funny before all else, with comedy inspired by the likes of Taika Waititi. We strive for humour that anyone can appreciate, and writing that won't force you to mute your speakers when playing in public. So snuggle up with your favourite floofball and discover Nine Noir Lives!",

Combining our favourite elements of everything that came before, we hope to mix it up into something deeply entertaining.While we've drawn on film noir for the story's inspiration, we're leaning much more towards the comedy side of &quot;comedy-noir&quot;. Expect some serious topics, addressed seriously - but we don't want to burden the whole game down under the weight of unrelenting grittiness. We feel that there's enough of that in the world already.Fun comes first, and we aim to be funny before all else, with comedy inspired by the likes of Taika Waititi. We strive for humour that anyone can appreciate, and writing that won't force you to mute your speakers when playing in public. So snuggle up with your favourite floofball and discover Nine Noir Lives!",
