Explore your surroundings, that change through the progress of the storyline, and find out the truth, while something awaits you in the dark.This is my first attempt at making a game. I have no previous experience with game development or even coding.So I hope you enjoy. :)",

        "Detailed Description": "A pointy-clicky corporate thriller that’s a little bit Monkey Island, a little bit Metal Gear Solid, and which is kinda like a Kafkaesque version of 1984 – so long as your definition of ‘kinda like’ is quite broad.What I can say is that this is most definitely a point-and-click adventure video game, and it’s one I think you should probably buy.Intriguing plot!Tom’s dangerously late for work, he hasn’t started his big Project AGER pitch, and – to be frank – he doesn’t even know what Project AGER is. Maybe because its true nature is much more disturbing than he could ever possibly understand... But we’ll get to that.Either way, getting up to his desk without Mr Biggleboss suspecting anything won’t be easy. In his way stands a boatload of bureaucracy, a furlong of fetch quests, and a pretty ominous set of warnings from a mysterious voice in the air vents.Just what is going on at Biggleboss Inc.? What does it have to do with Tom? And why does it suddenly feel like his day is only set to get weirder?In The Biggleboss Incident, you’ll solve puzzles, shirk responsibility, and figure out what’s really happening behind the scenes in the world’s weirdest office.Look at the moving pictures and hear the lovely noises!This game is fully voiced by real human beings who all got paid for their talent and time. It’s also got lots of whizzy animations and cutscenes and fun touches that took ages to do.This is a game I made with my own bare hands!It took me like five years, so if you play it I sure hope you like it. If you don’t then I guess I’ll try and make something better next time. Maybe something with guns and a season pass.It’s (hopefully) funny and entertaining and intriguing, and functions – for all intents and purposes – like a genuine video game. It doesn’t push the genre forward or break any new ground or anything, but I’ll leave that stuff to the pros. And, hey, if you ignore some of the rougher edges I’ll forget all about that embarrassing thing you did that one time. You know the one.Anyway it should take you around 6~ hours to complete, but it’s hard to tell with these things. It largely depends on how fast you figure out the puzzle with the coffee.Game features:Voices!Pointing!Clicking!Intrigue and mystery!Mild peril!A bit where you can flick a light switch that serves absolutely no purpose!Pervasive, crushing satire about the pointlessness of corporate culture!",

        "Detailed Description": "Loki, the god of trickery, is up to his grandest scheme yet and to see it to fruition, Baldr, the god of wisdom and light, must be out of the way. Slain by Loki, Baldr is cast to the underworld. Loki uses this opportunity to his advantage to introduce intoxicating technology to the Aesir and dwarves, which the dwarves embed into the world causing an imbalance. Reborn by Hel, Baldr must restore balance to the world and regain godhood. Over Light Reforged, the player travels between four of the realms of Norse mythology. These include Helheim, the home of the dead; Asgard, the home of the Aesir; Vanaheim, the home of the Vanir; and Svartalfheim, the home of the Dwarves. \r\n\r\nThe Realms:\r\nVanaheim - realm of the Vanir and nature – is the last stand between Ivaldi and his goal of technological takeover. As such, it’s the most naturalistic and least steampunk in visual design. \r\nAsgard - Asgard  is more technologically advanced than Vanaheim. The Asgard arena is a sacred battleground, but small glimpses of technology can be seen around the outer rim of the arena.\r\nSvartalfheim is home of the Dwarves and ruled by the Sons of Ivaldi. The city is the most corrupted realm, void of any lush nature. The water and sky are stained red from use of the magic cores. Roads, sidewalks, and large buildings are dirtied by the smog that persists through the city. Located in the city are three cores that power the city.\r\n\r\nThroughout the game, the player has multiple combat mechanics at their disposal for fighting different enemies throughout the levels: a dash, a melee attack, projectile weapons, the Prismatic Light Meter, and special actions. \r\n\r\nUse The Elements To Fight:\r\n As you fight you increase your Prismatic Light Meter. Prismatic Light allows you to use the elements to the advantage. There are three elements that can be chosen from. Fire, Ice, and Wind. Each of these elements has three tiers. Each elements offer a variety of offensive and defensive capabilities. You can get burn damage on your enemy over time, freeze them in place, or blow away large groups of enemies.\r\n\r\nHack N Slash Your Way Through:\r\nLight Reforged focuses on hacking and slashing your enemies. Use fluid combat to strategically dodge enemies and gain the advantage on your foes. Challenge bosses and a variety of enemies throughout the realm that require you to think before you jump. If you feel overwhelmed, use your cannon to clear waves of enemies. Use your dash to mow through hordes and slash enemies as they try to surround you.",

You find yourself in a cozy airplane hanger, seated in a cockpit. As you attempt to start your flight, a glowing cave fades in around you. You go through the standard flight checks, testing your controls, and begin to glitch through overwhelming and disorienting spaces. Terms and conditions fly by you, the love you've never had is advertised – demanded – of you, your interests are weaponized in your workplace, and you're forced to see visceral vulnerability. Finally, space seems to collapse onto itself, threatening to overpower you, but you find yourself flying into a never-ending void. Will you end your terminal connection?terminal connection is an observation of the resting state of capitalist-hyperreality. Capitalist-hyperreality is a phenomenon brought about by the exponential growth of hyperreal influences within a capitalistic structure. Hyperreality is – the abstracted and self-referential understanding of reality that comes about as a result of human communication and, more relevantly, mass media. It identifies the distance we have created between our subjective realities and objective reality as a result of our construction of experienced reality based on the subjectivity of others rather than what actually might be real. If a rare flower were to be found in the modern day, a hyperreal construct of the flower would be created through language, videos, images, songs, artworks, and poems of said flower. The average person’s understanding of the flower would almost certainly be based on the hyperreal construct of the flower, and more hyperreal constructs would be created based on the existing hyperreal constructs. This perpetuating web of abstraction extends until the real flower itself is nearly forgotten. Only a minute few would have ever actually seen the real flower.terminal connection diagnoses the consequences of when hyperreal abstraction is driven by monetary incentives. This game is a metaphor for doomscrolling and expects to simulate the emotions brought forth by ever invasive social media, in a critical space. We hope to accentuate the adverse consequences of capital incentives on the otherwise natural processes of abstraction spreading throughout mass media. We've attempted to depict some of the relational cycles of oppression/oppressing present in capital driven social media and provide the player with the first step out of the cycle - the moment you choose to leave.Extensive writing about terminal connection and the process of creating it can be found on our blog, .",

        "Detailed Description": "FRAY spawned from the story of Tullio and Ziya, two deeply bonded brothers who share a passion for movement, hip hop culture, and a competitive zeal for video games.  Their brotherly connection frays as the elder brother Ziya is lured into a wondrous video game world by Lucious, a beguiling AI character he conjures up for a gaming contest.  The contest calls for building a great puzzle game, but as Ziya’s foray into AI blurs the line between real and virtual, the brothers are drawn into a real-life quandary in which restoring the frayed connections of their relationship means confronting the reality that people are the greatest puzzles of all.The FRAY team invites fans into both worlds through a hip hop dance theatre production, and through  a video game for PC's launching on Steam June 15th.

        "Short Description": "FRAY Game is a rhythm based puzzle game about two brothers Tullio and Ziya. Take control of Tullio to move to the beat and master energy blasting dance moves to light the way through a maze-like world of dance challenges and to battle cunning enemies who attempt to break the bond between brothers.",
        "About the Game": "FRAY spawned from the story of Tullio and Ziya, two deeply bonded brothers who share a passion for movement, hip hop culture, and a competitive zeal for video games.  Their brotherly connection frays as the elder brother Ziya is lured into a wondrous video game world by Lucious, a beguiling AI character he conjures up for a gaming contest.  The contest calls for building a great puzzle game, but as Ziya’s foray into AI blurs the line between real and virtual, the brothers are drawn into a real-life quandary in which restoring the frayed connections of their relationship means confronting the reality that people are the greatest puzzles of all.The FRAY team invites fans into both worlds through a hip hop dance theatre production, and through  a video game for PC's launching on Steam June 15th.

Pesky beings and trials of the gods stand in your way.- If you're afraid of heights, beware of the gameplay.The game is basically a permadeath jumping platformer.Yeah... It's the game you're imagining, but maybe a little different.Because it's always nice to fly through the sky, and it might just reduce your anger and stress.If you ever imagined as a kid running around on top of the clouds, Unreal Engine can now make that dream come true.In this world, there is day and night. Enjoy flying through the beautiful sky as it changes from hour to hour.Collect scattered constellations and stitch them into the night sky to make your journey more romantic.",

        "Detailed Description": "Automata Streetcar is an interactive, digital-media art project that uses historic streetcars as a metaphor to explore ideas about connection, communication, and community.  The project is inspired by the four historic streetcar systems that once operated in British Columba - in Victoria, Vancouver, North Vancouver, and in particular the small, remote mountain community of Nelson.  ​As mechanical devices, streetcars may be interpreted as a type of automata: self-guided, interactive mechanisms that respond to a sequence of predetermined instructions.  They follow a fixed track through city streets, stopping to collect passengers at predetermined locations, operating within a sequential yet highly interactive environment.The project is primarily intended to be a gallery / museum installation in which visitors use custom-made game controllers to interact with a digital recreation of Nelson's main street, as it was 100 years ago when streetcars operated there.  Players take on the roles of the conductor and driver to operate a streetcar, collect passengers, and build community confidence. The project can also be downloaded directly to experience at home, using either home-built Arduino-based game controllers, or a standard keyboard and mouse arrangement.Home Play VersionThe project can be downloaded and played at home with a standard keyboard and mouse arrangement, or with two home-built, Arduino-based game controllers (one for the streetcar conductor, and one for the streetcar driver). The home play option was developed using Arduino Uno R3 compatible controller boards.  If you wish to build your own Arduino-based game controllers, you will need a separate USB connection and one Arduino-compatible controller board (plus other parts and components) for each game-controller (the materials and components are not included).",

The project is inspired by the four historic streetcar systems that once operated in British Columba - in Victoria, Vancouver, North Vancouver, and in particular the small, remote mountain community of Nelson.  ​As mechanical devices, streetcars may be interpreted as a type of automata: self-guided, interactive mechanisms that respond to a sequence of predetermined instructions.  They follow a fixed track through city streets, stopping to collect passengers at predetermined locations, operating within a sequential yet highly interactive environment.The project is primarily intended to be a gallery / museum installation in which visitors use custom-made game controllers to interact with a digital recreation of Nelson's main street, as it was 100 years ago when streetcars operated there.  Players take on the roles of the conductor and driver to operate a streetcar, collect passengers, and build community confidence. The project can also be downloaded directly to experience at home, using either home-built Arduino-based game controllers, or a standard keyboard and mouse arrangement.Home Play VersionThe project can be downloaded and played at home with a standard keyboard and mouse arrangement, or with two home-built, Arduino-based game controllers (one for the streetcar conductor, and one for the streetcar driver). The home play option was developed using Arduino Uno R3 compatible controller boards.  If you wish to build your own Arduino-based game controllers, you will need a separate USB connection and one Arduino-compatible controller board (plus other parts and components) for each game-controller (the materials and components are not included).",

        "Detailed Description": "Background SettingIn a future world, an explorer named Shimo, who has lost his childhood memories, arrives at a place known as a &quot;singularity&quot;—a sealed town shrouded in thick fog—in search of his origins and recollections. However, on his very first night there, a murder occurs, marking just the beginning of a series of events. As Shimu gradually forms bonds with others, he works to solve these incidents while also uncovering the truth behind the town. Ultimately, this truth leads back to his own identity and lost memories.Gameplay OverviewThe basic controls involve using the keyboard and mouse to move the character around the horizontal screen, interact with objects, and solve puzzles. The puzzle-solving aspect involves collecting clues through dialogue and investigation. During subsequent group discussion sessions, players use the information they have to agree or disagree with others' opinions, present clues, identify contradictions, and ultimately uncover the truth.Game FeaturesStoryline StructureThe game features a storyline with multiple branching options, allowing players to explore various endings flexibly.Puzzle DesignThe game's puzzles emphasize &quot;orthodox detection&quot; elements, designed based on the form of orthodox detection to create a classic plot structure akin to &quot;Ten Little Indians.&quot; They focus on clue collection and logical reasoning, enhancing the player's immersion and providing a direct experience of the pleasure of logical deduction while deeply engaging in the game's detective mode.Game SystemThe game includes systems such as notes, inventory, clues, and maps that serve the plot and facilitate the narrative and deduction aspects.Art StyleThe game employs a low saturation and washed-out style that combines 2D and 3D elements, creating a sense of subdued colors and fading tones. This visual approach conveys a tranquil yet melancholic atmosphere, offering a unique aesthetic experience within the game.Music StyleThe game music consists of original compositions by Evalia-爱娃、沉林川、黑金雨, and more. The original soundtrack will be available for purchase at a later date.",

Unlimited means you can theoretically keep placing micro blocks until you crash the game!  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────The Final Keeper has a large focus on itemization, bossing, and RPG mechanics: Itemization:Every mob in the world has a chance to drop an item besides their normal loot table.Every mob you kill will become a spawnable mob type in the underworld, allowing you to farm them deterministically.But don't stay in the underworld too long as things will get nightmarishly worse the longer you stay.Farmed loot from the underworld includes bosses which drop their own unique items with variable modifiers. Dropped items will be generated with various algorithms and loot tables to make sure that every item is unique in its own way.Bossing:On your journey, you will encounter very challenging and rewarding bosses that will put your skills to the test.The Final Keeper has no difficulty options, we strongly believe in making a game that is fun to play, Enjoying the game is mandatory,progressing further in it however... is entirely optional and will depend on your skill and gear!RPG mechanics:The power gained from killing mobs comes in the form of XP, There are currently 30 levels in the game.Each level up will offer you an ultimatum between 2 unique character upgrades, choosing one will lock the other one, adding impact to every choice you make and enforcing build diversity.On the other hand you can play multiple characters within one world, such as having separate bossing and farming builds.Each mob will resist certain types of damage and be weaker to others, encouraging the player to have multiple loadouts of gear.And putting the extra gear you get from looting to good use.  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────There is a lot more waiting for you in the forgotten world of The Final Keeper!The Final Keeper is being developed by an entirely independent indie studio, and is using a funding campaign to support the development of the game.",

Rebuild the ship’s fragile ecosystems before the ship reaches the end of its journey. Procedurally generated characters and storylines mean that every journey — spanning several hundred years — will be uniquely yours. Build and rebuild a functioning city, carefully marshalling scarce resources. Tear down inefficient buildings and use their materials to make better ones! Craft a sustainable circular economy, using biological waste to grow new vital resources and repurposing material waste into new structures, tools and technologies. Lay out your city to maximize benefits, providing synergies to benefit your population’s wellbeing and to restore the ship’s damaged ecosystems. Near-future solarpunk setting anchored in real-world ecological calamities and opportunities. The ship’s characters are procedurally generated at the start of playthrough, resulting in a unique cast of NPCs every game. Events differ in every playthrough, according to large and small choices you make — and how you treat people. Aboard this generation ship, characters will form families and you will get to know them as well as their descendants. Memories pass down through generations, meaning choices you made in the past will be remembered in the future. Community is important to your survival — but not everyone agrees with each other. You’ll encounter all kinds of people aboard the ship, some of whom are more helpful and friendly than others. As you build your society, this will trigger situations and crises where you must determine a path forward. These choices will have consequences for how you manage resources, research new technologies and develop each of the ship’s biomes. Build a roster of talented experts to accomplish tasks, each of whom has different skills and traits as well as opinions of one another — not always positive ones!

How do you decide? You hesitate over whether the tape should be tossed in her box, simply labeled Emily.When you close your eyes, you dream of her.When the lights are off, you see her. Not her exactly, but the past version of her. Is that even accurate? Perhaps it’s simply a version of her you’ve created in your head. You see her everywhere - the kitchen, the bedroom, and the balcony. Who knew such a tiny apartment could contain so many ghosts of her. You decide what you say to her. You rehearse these conversations even though you know the ending.Are you afraid to find closure?As Walter, you will reluctantly pack away all the objects from a past relationship. Heartbreak exists in every crevice and in the seemingly most ordinary items. Can all the ghosts and the heavy weight of the past fit in a cardboard box? It seems impossible, and yet, you will try anyway. Wrestle with Walter’s mental health, listen to the whispers of old memories, and find some closure.",

        "Detailed Description": "Return to the Summer of 2007...Once somewhat of a local legend in their hometown, Mallory turned down a record deal in favour of a scholarship a decade ago. To say that they felt a bit of regret would be an understatement; they spent the bulk of their university years watching their former band mates sell out shows and records, stewing in bitterness the whole time.After several years of rejection and struggling, they've finally gotten a second chance in their grasp —  only to question whether it's something they even want anymore.After years of hard work, Mal has finally gotten everything they've always dreamed of: their band, No Prospects, landed a coveted spot on the 2007 Friends and Foes summer tour, and their latest single has been picked up by some big radio stations. So they should be happy, right?The bassist of The Fractured —  the current band that's on the playlist of everyone who's in-the-know. Most would consider Emerson's quiet and withdrawn nature ill-suited for the spotlight, so it's fortunate that he seems to get overshadowed by the rest of his group.Mallory’s best friend from university who was dragged into No Prospects largely against her will. Despite her initial reluctance, ever-critical Di has since given her all in every single performance – and won’t hesitate to point out anyone she believes to be dead weight.An old friend of Mallory's from their teenage basement show years. Having spent the past decade turning down permanent positions in favour of juggling odd jobs with occasional freelance session work, Beckett surprised everyone when he joined No Prospects.A last minute addition to No Prospects after the abrupt departure of their previous guitarist, Lucas struggles to keep his head above water in a sea full of industry veterans. What he lacks in technical skill, he more than makes up for in pure enthusiasm.

        "About the Game": "Return to the Summer of 2007...Once somewhat of a local legend in their hometown, Mallory turned down a record deal in favour of a scholarship a decade ago. To say that they felt a bit of regret would be an understatement; they spent the bulk of their university years watching their former band mates sell out shows and records, stewing in bitterness the whole time.After several years of rejection and struggling, they've finally gotten a second chance in their grasp —  only to question whether it's something they even want anymore.After years of hard work, Mal has finally gotten everything they've always dreamed of: their band, No Prospects, landed a coveted spot on the 2007 Friends and Foes summer tour, and their latest single has been picked up by some big radio stations. So they should be happy, right?The bassist of The Fractured —  the current band that's on the playlist of everyone who's in-the-know. Most would consider Emerson's quiet and withdrawn nature ill-suited for the spotlight, so it's fortunate that he seems to get overshadowed by the rest of his group.Mallory’s best friend from university who was dragged into No Prospects largely against her will. Despite her initial reluctance, ever-critical Di has since given her all in every single performance – and won’t hesitate to point out anyone she believes to be dead weight.An old friend of Mallory's from their teenage basement show years. Having spent the past decade turning down permanent positions in favour of juggling odd jobs with occasional freelance session work, Beckett surprised everyone when he joined No Prospects.A last minute addition to No Prospects after the abrupt departure of their previous guitarist, Lucas struggles to keep his head above water in a sea full of industry veterans. What he lacks in technical skill, he more than makes up for in pure enthusiasm.

        "Detailed Description": "Wobbler is a racing game where you accelerate while turning, and decelerate while going forward. These unique physics are designed to be simple &amp; forgiving for more casual players, yet hard to master for those looking for a serious challenge. Wobble your way to first place as you find the optimal routes through a series of unique levels*, and challenge your friends or other players for the best times! Alternatively, cook up a level only you can beat!When it comes to racing in Wobbler, there are only two controls: turning left, or turning right. Despite such simplicity, you may be surprised just how in-depth these two controls can get!In this minimalistic world made up of basic shapes &amp; vibrant colors, you can get up to speeds of 2,000 km/h! There are levels ranging from Easy to Very Hard difficulty. Some are slower paced with a stronger focus on parkour, routing, and precision, while others are extremely fast paced and will require optimal planning &amp; reaction times to succeed. Level completion should be achievable for most players, but competing for the top may not be for everyone!Wobbler has a heavy focus on &quot;speedrunning&quot; and includes a few handy technical features such as:Accurate and consistent built-in timers (tied to physics, with 0.01s precision).Race replay files: autosaves your last 25, your personal bests for every level, and you can manually save any race you want. They can be viewed at any time, and slowed down or sped up.File tampering detection: if you manually edit a replay or level file outside of the game, it will say it's been tampered with when you load this file in-game, and prevent you from creating replays with tampered levels.Statistics tracking: Lifetime stats, as well as 3 sets of resettable stats which can be used to track various types of challenges or accurately time multi-level races.Ease of file sharing and usage: all generated files are organized within the game's folder, and you can load from any folder.Wobbler comes with a built-in level editor which is simple enough for anyone to create a level, while also including advanced features for more complex levels:Grid-based placement: Simpler to use, allows for faster level prototyping, and encourages consistent designs.Full control over node properties: Despite the grid-based placement, you have full control over scaling, rotation, alignment, and position offset, allowing fine control over level nodes regardless of their grid position.Access to advanced behaviors: You may place lights, speedboosts, and triggers, visible or invisible, which can teleport the player to other locations, hide/show other level nodes, and more. These behaviors allow you to create complex levels which teleport the player to new areas, unlock/create new areas as the player reaches other areas, or even things like puzzle/maze levels.Built-in thumbnail generator: When saving a level, a thumbnail is automatically generated, and the camera placement for this can be customized. Alternatively, you can also manually create a thumbnail before uploading your level to the workshop.Two camera styles: There is the primary top-down &quot;2D&quot; isometric view, allowing for a quick overview &amp; an intuitive linear level building experience, as well as a 3D camera preview to help with adjusting complex structures or levels involving height.Impossible level prevention: Level creators must beat their own level and include their replay with it before it can be uploaded to the Workshop. Level files may still be shared and loaded privately before being uploaded to the Workshop, so it is possible to have a friend or team collaborate on beating a near-impossible level before its upload.The built-in level editor is somewhat primitive compared to others out there, but it has everything you need for both simple or complex levels, while remaining simple enough to be accessible for everyone. We're looking forward to seeing what the community can create with it! Note: The level editor currently does NOT allow importing new models or textures, only using the built-in ones.*Early access disclaimer: There are currently a lot less native levels in place than there will be in the future. We're hoping to create up to 36-40 total native levels. It's also worth noting, the Level Editor and Steam Workshop are entirely functional, allowing all players to create their own!",

        "Detailed Description": "Play as the vengeful secret agent Virginia West as she takes on a silver-obsessed madman known as The Silver Fox in this single-player interactive spy novel. Surveil your enemy, get revenge for your partner's demise, and maybe - just maybe - save the world while you're at it. Sometimes it's best ... to do your worst! Your MissionYour target is a madman known as The Silver Fox. You may be familiar with villains who lust after gold, but not so with this guy. He loves silver and despises gold - so much so that he plans to destroy the Golden Gate Bridge!  Even though it's not gold at all! We previously sent in your partner, Franklin Benjamin, to deal with the situation and protect the bridge. But unfortunately, he's been lost in the line of duty, so this mission now falls to you, Virginia West. Get close to this madman, unravel his scheme, and stop him in his tracks. The fate of a national landmark rests on your shoulders and your shoulders alone. This is a single-player game, after all There's Always a Madman: Do Your Worst can be played with just a mouse. Gameplay consists of selecting the action or dialog you wish to take given the situation you’re facing. Although the life of a secret agent is complicated, playing There's Always a Madman: Do Your Worst is simple Sequel or StandaloneThere's Always a Madman: Do Your Worst is the second entry in the There's Always a Madman series, but it tells a standalone story.  Like a classic James Bond novel or film where you can pick any one up independent of the rest, you can pick this story up without having experienced any prior stories in the There's Always a Madman franchise.  However, I would recommend playing the first game There's Always a Madman: Fight or Flight before this game if you care to experience the series in its intended order Cat and MouseAs a secret agent, it's not about who has the fastest trigger finger. Put your mind to good use and make intelligent in-the-moment decisions on how best to handle your current predicament.

        "About the Game": "Play as the vengeful secret agent Virginia West as she takes on a silver-obsessed madman known as The Silver Fox in this single-player interactive spy novel. Surveil your enemy, get revenge for your partner's demise, and maybe - just maybe - save the world while you're at it. Sometimes it's best ... to do your worst! Your MissionYour target is a madman known as The Silver Fox. You may be familiar with villains who lust after gold, but not so with this guy. He loves silver and despises gold - so much so that he plans to destroy the Golden Gate Bridge!  Even though it's not gold at all! We previously sent in your partner, Franklin Benjamin, to deal with the situation and protect the bridge. But unfortunately, he's been lost in the line of duty, so this mission now falls to you, Virginia West. Get close to this madman, unravel his scheme, and stop him in his tracks. The fate of a national landmark rests on your shoulders and your shoulders alone. This is a single-player game, after all There's Always a Madman: Do Your Worst can be played with just a mouse. Gameplay consists of selecting the action or dialog you wish to take given the situation you’re facing. Although the life of a secret agent is complicated, playing There's Always a Madman: Do Your Worst is simple Sequel or StandaloneThere's Always a Madman: Do Your Worst is the second entry in the There's Always a Madman series, but it tells a standalone story.  Like a classic James Bond novel or film where you can pick any one up independent of the rest, you can pick this story up without having experienced any prior stories in the There's Always a Madman franchise.  However, I would recommend playing the first game There's Always a Madman: Fight or Flight before this game if you care to experience the series in its intended order Cat and MouseAs a secret agent, it's not about who has the fastest trigger finger. Put your mind to good use and make intelligent in-the-moment decisions on how best to handle your current predicament.

After this you need to return to the box.Generally the people and animals just wander around or stand still but in one level the people are hiding behind houses and you have to chase after them in order to kill them.The Bible passage also says to not chop fruit trees and if you do the soldiers get annoyed.

        "Detailed Description": "Humanity has finally left its cradle in the 23rd century - in pursuit of profit. Megacorporations carve out spheres of influence and claim new worlds to develop. They’re only prevented from wiping each other out by the Charter: contracts between each other meant to contain their worst impulses… and keep their promises.Workers and borrowers get what they bargained for: nothing more or less. Corporate raids and wars visit untold horrors on millions. Mercenaries, pirates and rebels flocked to the unregulated stars, looking for money and freedom from Earth’s stultifying Unity Government, but it’s a harsh place.Your family survived the Third Corporate War, fleeing to the fringes of human settlement to find peace as terraformers and farmers. However, a tragedy forces them back into wet-work for one of the megacorps, to pay off their debt and survive an uncertain future.Star Ronin is a top-down action-adventure mixing tactical combat, exo-suits, and challenging mechanics. Realistic fields of view, sophisticated lighting systems, intelligent enemies, with a robust catalog of weapons and upgrades for your exos; you are free to approach each mission as you see fit. All that matters is completing the objective and securing a payout to bring your family closer to freedom.  Fast-paced top-down tactical action: approach each mission the way you like. Use your suit's thermoptic camouflage systems to sneak past enemies; deploy jetpacks to rush through rooms full of enemies or dodge incoming fire; deploy drones to gain an edge; or just go loud with the largest gun you have, shoot everything you see, and hope you can survive. Dynamic lighting system: The engine is built around a sophisticated, realistic lighting system. Lights and darkness are more than just decoration: Destroy light sources to gain the advantage and disorient your foes, use the suit's flashlight to navigate dark spaces for alternate routes, and immerse yourself in the atmosphere of a dark, megacorporate future. Unpredictable challenges and opportunities: Every mission and map is procedurally generated, from objectives and maps down to enemies, traps, and boss encounters. Fight from corporate offices to space stations, in dynamic environments where everything can be blown up, set on fire, or used in creative ways to gain an advantage. No two jobs are the same: one might make you rich fast, the other kill you just as swiftly.  Vast catalog of foes: In the 23rd century it's not just corporate goons with guns. Expect swarms of kamikaze bombs, robot dogs with flamethrower heads, and bosses with vicious abilities. Think on your feet, adjust your tactics, use the environment against them, and learn from each encounter to master Star Ronin's systems.  Deep crafting system: You can buy tons of gear on the market - or put that money towards paying off the family's debt and focus on crafting new weapons, exos, and upgrades. Craft to tailor each family member to your preferred style of gaming. Upgrade armor to make a tank, increase speed to gain an edge, or set up a generous power pool for the powerful, energy-hungry weapons. Multiple playable characters: Digging your family out of corporate debt is not a one-person job. Other family members do their part, each offering a unique playstyle, opportunities, and challenges - further customizable with weapons, armor, helpers, and other upgrades from a massive catalog of gear. Dynamic campaign with impossible choices: Each run is unique, with endless possibilities for working off the family's debt to the megacorp. Yes, the debt must be paid in full. The question is, how far are you willing to go? How low will you sink? How much of you will remain by the time you’ve fulfilled your contract? Customizable experience: Pick from four different difficulty levels, allowing you to focus on the story - or face a true test of your roguelike skills. Want to experiment? Star Ronin features a detailed tutorial and Arena mode to master the mechanics and test out different builds without risking your family's fate.",

By the way, responsibility for snapshots resulting from uploading inappropriate images and improper use of them in the electronic environment belongs to the user. Some of the voice acting has also been tweaked to be entertaining. You can find zombies with a radar also. You have basically two types of weapon, one is an automatic assault rifle, and the other one is a gun. Rifle has a wide range however gun is more accurate. You can control the character with the right, left, forward and back keys. You can change your perspective and shoot with the mouse. As you get points, zombies get faster and sometimes they can appear behind you off the radar! Meanwhile, sometimes you may hear sounds, you can ignore them, but sometimes they may actually belong to a zombie coming behind you.\r\nSince this is the first version, I kindly request that you not be too harsh in your criticism :) I tried to create it on my own with limited resources available to me. I have started gathering requests for the second version. I greatly need your valuable support...  I hope you like it.  Thank you very, very much.

Turn Based Gameplay The gameplay and combat is all turn based, allowing you to make strategic decisions. Enemies are dangerous, but polite, and will wait their turn. AlliancesSome characters will start the game with an alliance in place.  This can be very helpful in the early stages, especially for new players.  Alliances allow you to have some of the various denizens of the Great Abyss join your party, and help to fight other enemies.   New alliances can be formed during the game by finding and reading the right books.

        "Detailed Description": "Guards II is a straightforward turn-based tactic game with extremely simple rules, but very deep mechanics. The player needs to swap two heroes to make a move. It may sound easy, but in reality, it requires a lot of thinking and planning ahead.Features\tAn original turn-based Battle System.Eight heroes with unique abilities and battle techniques.A skills system with a variety of options.A complex upgrade tree for each hero.A reworked item system with many additions.Five different underworlds with a unique bestiary, divided into a total of 80 levels.Hell mode with an additional 80 missions, higher difficulty, new enemies, and other additions.Special in-game challenges for each mission to test the player's skills.GameplayThe main feature of the game is a unique turn-based battle system. You command a team of four heroes, with three of them fighting on the front line, while the fourth recovers health at the back. To make a move, you need to change the positions of any two heroes. When a hero moves from the back line to the front, they unleash a super attack. For example, the Monster Hunter fires an arrow storm that damages all enemies on the line and reduces their resistances, while the Alchemist heals an ally with a restoration potion.New features in the sequel\tGuards II is a sequel that introduces entirely new features to the game. Firstly, all heroes and enemies possess one of four attack types: Physical, Fire, Magic, and Death. Each unit has resistances against specific attack types, while also having vulnerabilities to others. Mastering the art of discovering the most effective attack type combination and exploiting enemy defenses constitutes one of the core strategic elements of the game.Another great addition to the game is the introduction of hero stances. Now, every hero has two stances that can be changed following certain rules. Each stance features a different attack type, resistances, way of performing a regular attack, and effects of the ultimate ability. For example, the Wizard in the first stance is just an ordinary spellcaster, hurling magic balls for regular attacks and more potent magic balls for the ultimate ability. However, when changed to the Fire Wizard form, it can attack any enemy on the battlefield with a regular fire attack, while the ultimate ability sends three meteors to an enemy in each line. All heroes have two stances, each offering diverse gameplay styles and strategic possibilities.Skills &amp; Upgrades\tIn the original game, each hero had only 9 upgrades. However, in the sequel, every hero now has a unique tech tree with over 30 upgrades, each comprising 2 to 3 levels. The player gets to choose which upgrades to learn first. Furthermore, the item system has been completely reworked. Items are no longer single-use. Instead, players accumulate a new resource that determines how many items they can bring into battle. The higher the value a player has, the more potent the items they can wield. Lastly, the number of skills has been increased from 5 to 7. These additional skills bring a lot of new strategic elements to the game. You can discover and learn about them in the game! Players can even bring a 5th hero into battle!Story and Challenge modesOn top of that, Guards II offers 160 missions thoughtfully divided into five completely different underworlds, each featuring unique monsters with their own abilities, as well as challenging end-world bosses. The game also includes a punishing Challenge mode designed for true strategy fans, which is exceptionally tough to beat. Furthermore, all missions in the game come with special in-game achievements that test the tactical skills of hardcore players.All of these features make Guards II one of the most captivating strategy games that all strategy fans should definitely give a try!",

Somehow, the evil dragon named “Steve” had found its way into Lil Johnny’s world—a world that had been blissfully calm until now. Steve’s scales shimmered with malevolence, and his eyes glowed like smoldering embers. The once-tranquil neighborhood now echoed with the dragon’s roars.\r\nLil Johnny armed with determination and a watermelon gun (yes, Lil Johnny had a watermelon garden and an endless supply of watermelons!), he set out to protect his home.\r\nThe dragon’s lair lay hidden in a faraway land within Lil Johnny’s world. To reach Steve, Lil Johnny would have to fight through nineteen rounds of timed levels. Each level required him to shoot targets, beating the ticking clock to advance. All this target practice would prepare him for the ultimate faceoff against Steve.\r\nAs the sun dipped lower, Lil Johnny stepped into the forest. The dragon’s roars echoed through the trees, shaking leaves loose from their branches. His heart pounded, but he remembered the countless hours spent coding, designing, and playtesting. This was his moment—the culmination of creativity and hard work.\r\nIn the end, it wasn’t about pixels or high scores. It was about courage, watermelons (lots of them), and relentless target practice. Lil Johnny’s legacy would be etched in watermelon juice and code—a testament to imagination, teamwork, and the magic that happens when a small group of students believes in the power of both.\r\nPlay your cards right, and Lil Johnny would face the evil dragon Steve, sending him packing for good. And so, in the heart of Ottawa, Canada, Lil Johnny’s Watermelon Smash became more than just a game—it became a legend.\r\nPanther Game Design Studio, a small high school class from Ottawa, poured their hearts into creating this Lowpoly world, a year long project run in their game design program.",

        "Detailed Description": "DisplaceMen is a magic realist ADV that depicts a seven-day mystery story with multiple scenarios and endings. In the coastal town of Huanmen, everyone knows how to 'displace'—to turn any item or even living being they own into another, as long as the two have equivalent psychological value. Displaced things will vanish and be forgotten. You are a broke painter who wanders around the town, collecting the strangest things to make art. While chatting with your commissioners, with a painter’s eye to observe and imagine, you will unveil the true faces of these people - the motivational speaker, the trace scholar with a day job as a tattoo artist, the hardcore cosplayer teenager, the wanted pseudoscientist, etc. Working to redeem the vanished “mermaid,” you will accumulate properties until you realize you can displace people. Deciding what to let go of is a painter’s practice. Stay sensitive. Stay gold. This game will provide a unique visual novel experience featuring multiple gameplay mechanics -Magic-Realist NarrativeExperience the mainstage “mermaid” mystery by making seamless decisions for multiple endings. Enjoy the satellite stories while exploring various locations in a town operating with the rules of displacement. Painterly Choice Branching Imagine the most impossible found objects as art material. Observe your subjects and chat with your clients to uncover their secrets. Make artistic decisions to enable story branching. Balance special personal values for characters to activate unique painting results. Displaceable CollectionCollect items and tokens of human ownership within the main story and sidequest. *Bonus: Displace your item or token at the right moment for the best value by watching your psychological values change triggered by events. Visceral Dream Sequence Solve small drag-and-drop puzzles while immersed in visceral dream sequences of the vanished “mermaid.” Witness the forgotten story emerging from beautifully intangible streams of consciousness. _*Love is an investment. This is a story for those who have the deepest love for things that are not present. We miss the things that are not here, and this drives us insane. We have different mechanisms to process this, and this game proposes two of them: 1, Keep talking to people, and 2, Keep making paintings.*By the way, the game can make you laugh a lot, especially at inappropriate moments.",

This world displays a unique landscape where glaciers live on islands and huge cliffs are common barriers and challenges to overcome.\r\n\r\nIn this gorgeous land each player starts with a small tribe including a village, a citizen and a ship and will grow to a full civilization with more of the pre-mentioned units but also temples, merchants and the precious highlanders, the only ones able to pass those astonishing cliffs.\r\n\r\nRise &amp; Fall is a very immersive and addictive game, easy to understand, with no luck or randomness involved.

        "Short Description": "Risse &amp; Fall is a game involving strategic units positioning, territory control and opportunity seizing designed by Christophe Boelinger (Dungeon Twister, Earth Reborn, Archipelago, Living Planet...). Each player leads a nation trying to expand and progress in a fantasy world.",
        "About the Game": "Rise &amp; Fall is a full control strategic game. Each player controls a civilization trying to expand and progress in a fantasy world. This world displays a unique landscape where glaciers live on islands and huge cliffs are common barriers and challenges to overcome.\r\n\r\nIn this gorgeous land each player starts with a small tribe including a village, a citizen and a ship and will grow to a full civilization with more of the pre-mentioned units but also temples, merchants and the precious highlanders, the only ones able to pass those astonishing cliffs.\r\n\r\nRise &amp; Fall is a very immersive and addictive game, easy to understand, with no luck or randomness involved. The initial creation of the world by itself is a real pleasure and each game brings a different map to the table.\r\n\r\nThe new players will enjoy the game for its “easy access” aspect. Since all the actions you can do are displayed on the six cards of a player’s deck, this makes the game really accessible right from the start.\r\n\r\nThe more exigent strategist players will love the game for its full control aspect and the fact that the learning curve seems to be a constant line of progression.",

Start in the Amateur Tournament, where duelists from three villages clash for supremacy. Prove your worth to advance to the Pro Tournament, facing challengers from three more villages. Your ultimate goal? The Grand Summoners Tournament, where champions from all villages compete for glory! But beware, summoner your card skills serve a higher purpose. As a guardian of the realm, you must seal the dangerous void cracks threatening to tear your world apart.

What begins as a journey to prove yourself in the Amateur ranks soon reveals a sinister plot that threatens the very fabric of your reality.

They're widening the void breaches, preparing for a catastrophic assault that will culminate at the Grand Summoners Tournament. Your mission becomes clear: master your deck, outsmart your opponents, and climb the tournament ranks. But the stakes are higher than mere victory.

Engage in summoner battles to catch unique monsters and transform them into exclusive cards for your collection. For strategic additions, purchase specific cards from clan forts.

This gaming behavior may have medical, psychological and social roots.In some species, games take on a competitive nature to help them survive through skill development. In order for the game to be fair and productive, rules arise.Thus, play is a principle, an instinct, inherent in animals, which contributes to the development of skills and social connections.Consequently, the original scheme of the animal was the framework on which generations hung more and more new discoveries that they found in their animal nature.And the scheme became more and more complicated and reached its peak at the birth of Arcade and Three-dimensional games.The developers of these two periods wrote the game in its full form, both external and internal.The game was assembled, and its internal state was expressed.But despite their enormous skill, they still did not complete the idea of the animal:\tIndulging, as in authority, instincts in code.And it is a mistake to believe that their time was the brightest flowering in media and that the younger generation needs to strive for this ideal at all costs.This idea is false.It draws young forces away from the modern flow of life, thereby disfiguring them.Their bodies fly on airplanes, and art and life are covered with old robes of Meiers and Miyamotos.Therefore, they cannot notice the new beauty in our modern life.For they live on the beauty of past decades.That's why Walking Simulators, Simulators of poor stones, Experimental games, Art games, Not games and Black Screen were incomprehensible.These designers threw off the robes of the past and stepped out into modern life and found new beauties.And I say:\tThat no industry dungeons can withstand the coming time.\tConcepts move and are born, and we make new and new discoveries.\tAnd what is open by us cannot be closed.\tAnd it is absurd to force our time into the old concepts of the past.The technical side of our time is moving further and further forward, and games are trying to move further and further back.That is why all those people who follow their time are higher, greater and more valuable.And shooters of the 21st century are much more than the former romance and challenge of the Arcade and Platformer period.Fig gardenOur time of the 21st century is multifaceted, many conflicting truths are being fought.A shopping area is imagined, where the crowd looks like collectible figurines that have come out of gaming stores onto the street of experimentalism.They laugh, they are indignant, they are surprised that everything is no longer similar, entertaining. And they rejoice when they see old games, franchises, posters, art books, retro console cartridges, keychains, gamepads or joysticks.At the head of the junk square are experienced sellers-authorities, offering high-quality goods, skillfully woven with aesthetics, taste and fun.And others said more simply: «Pure entertainment and nothing more.»Young people flock to these sales festivals, and smart authorities dress in Sakaguchi’s shirt, Miyamoto’s tie, polo from Meier's time, glasses of modern Miyazakis;covering their heads with a philistine cap, young people flaunt themselves on holidays in the garden of industry genres!And the maestros are happy, because the tombstone was erected on modern young souls.

But where it was no longer possible to hide and the stereotypes overstepped their boundaries, the authorities covered up this debauchery with the fig leaves of graphics.The entire fig garden of the gaming industry was guarded so that the uglies would not penetrate its fence, tear off the fig leaves and destroy the beauty of the garden.The youth fell asleep in fragrant graphic well-being, and only the elders stayed awake, protecting them from evil trends.But one fine day a comet appeared on the horizon, the noise and the whirlwind came to the elders, everything trembled from their whirlwind, the tail of the comet — the Screen — swept away, knocking down all the trinkets of the old foundations.ABANDON THE SUITCASES OF WISDOMWe are the generation of the 21st century — the result of the old and the page of a new book, the credit of time opened to us, we have completed a volume of 5 decades, and a new book of old, outdated foundations has been added to our archive library.

As of recently however, the seal has begun to weaken and the darkness has begun pouring back into the world in the form of a demon called Inikka who has sworn himself to the Dark One and has established his own Empire within a nearby land overseas known as the Outerrealms, with the intention of conquering all of Orgathus with his army of The Shadowless, corrupt creatures who can influence the minds of the people, replacing love and compassion with pure lust and aggression, turning them into hulking beasts of unbridled sexual intensity. The only hope of saving the continent is a pure-hearted hero chosen by the Guardian Angels to become the next Celestial Knight to reunite the 5 Dik Crystals within each Kingdom and prevent the resurrection of the Dark One once again.The Holy Kingdom, Pantheron lies at the center of the continent and is a very prosperous country that is very ahead of its time, dedicated to the Guardian Angel Ramiel and the Divine One. Pantheron contains several thriving cities and tribes, home to a large population of humans, elves, and barbarians who live together peacefully, ruled by the kind-hearted King Jericho and his 5 sons. The city is well known for its bountiful harvest as well as its advances in technology thanks to the power of the Earth Dik Crystal entrusted to them by Ramiel to watch over until the day it is needed. The country’s colors are blue and gold to represent the sky and sun, the home of the angels.CHARACTERSRace: Human Age: 22 Hometown: Remaire City, Pantheron Kingdom Occupation: Knight, Blacksmith (part-time) Duncan Carpenter is part of a wide-scale, Blacksmithing family company, currently owned by his father, and next in line to inherit the business as the oldest of the next generation.

Whether it's programming, editing or making art, each contract comes with its own set of challenges and opportunities, so choose wisely! Humans are reliable and skilled workers, capable of tackling a variety of tasks with precision and expertise, and it is not much difficult to manage their needs. Goblins, on the other hand, may be a bit mischievous and difficult to manage, but they possess unique abilities that can't be matched. Each race has unique characteristics and you will need to mix them in order to achieve the greatest productivity.Managing these mystical creatures isn't just about putting them to work – it's also about keeping them happy and motivated, after all if you had to work 24 hours a day you too would have a burnout. The giant human, for example, works better if you give him a beer. Goblins, meanwhile, work better if you don't push them outside of their comfort zones, so give them medieval equipments and they will be grateful for not having to learn all this new technology.As you navigate the ups and downs of running your business, you'll encounter all sorts of obstacles, from taxes to magical occurences.

        "Detailed Description": "In ANGST, you awaken alone in a vast, frozen wilderness, where survival is your only goal. The icy winds howl, wolves prowl the dark forests, and every resource must be fought for. Chop down trees to build fires that stave off the biting cold, craft weapons from scavenged materials, and struggle to stay alive. The world of ANGST is unforgiving, but beneath the snow and ice lie secrets waiting to be uncovered. How long can you survive in this hostile land before the darkness closes in? By day, you hunt and gather, chopping wood to build fires and crafting weapons to protect yourself. By night, the wilderness comes alive with deadly creatures and strange entities that react to your actions. Some will guide you, while others seek to end your journey as quickly as it began. Don’t trust everything you see—some things want to help, while others lurk in the shadows, waiting to strike. How you navigate the world is up to you, but survival is never guaranteed.As you navigate the wilderness, uncover the mysteries hidden within the hollow. Who are you, and why are you here? Complete quests that slowly reveal the world’s hidden past and your place within it. Encounter mysterious entities that react to your choices, subtly pushing you toward your fate. The story unfolds through exploration and survival—each quest brings you closer to uncovering the truth, but every step deeper into the wild also brings greater peril.Every choice in ANGST shapes your survival. Brave the wilderness by day, gathering food, wood, and supplies to endure the night. Craft tools, weapons, and shelter to push deeper into the Hollow’s dangerous biomes, where each death teaches you a lesson and unlocks new skills. Adapt to the ever-changing environment, upgrade your character, and choose how you evolve to face the escalating threats. Build a survival strategy that suits your play style, but remember—what works one day may not save you the next.Step into an expansive world where no two survival experiences are the same. Explore dense forests, frozen rivers, and desolate plains, each biome presenting unique challenges. Scavenge through abandoned cabins, cut down trees for firewood, and fish in icy waters. But beware—every sound in the distance could mean danger, and the deeper you venture, the deadlier it becomes. The open world of ANGST is as beautiful as it is brutal, and only the most prepared will survive its many dangers.Survive the wilderness of ANGST alone or with friends. In online co-op mode, team up with others to explore The Hollow together. Share resources, fight side by side against predators, and work shoulder to shoulder to craft tools and build shelter. Brave the hostile environment, uncover its secrets, and see how long you can survive in this frozen limbo.",

        "Detailed Description": "Unfortunately due to geopolitical reason, production is postponed until further announcement.Welcome to AirFlow, where the vast expanse of the sky becomes your battleground! Prepare to embark on adrenaline-fueled adventures in epic aerial combat like never before. In AirFlow, you'll pilot powerful airplanes in intense battles for sky, land and sea, mastering the art of dodging enemy fire, while strategically outmaneuvering foes to claim dominance over the skies. Are you ready to take control and rule the heavens? Join the fray and soar to new heights in AirFlow!Planned Key FeaturesGame settings (As in pre alpha development stage, all features are subject to change) Game settings are in fantasy, futuristic, steampunk / dieselpunk postapocalyptic world, with procedurally generated islands. So each game is different experience.  Possible to play together in split-screen mode, in co-op, or as an opponents with family member, or friend on the same PC (none online).Your responsibilities as a pilot and squadron commander You are the pilot and squadron commander of Diesel Strider nation. You are responsible for building and managing your squadrons of fighters and bombers, to assist in avionic missions against Nano Nexus Syndicate. As the pilot with your assisting squadrons, you will be fighting against other airplanes, which are protecting enemy territory, as well as islands and naval defenses. You need to eliminate all enemies, while protecting own assets and aircraft carrier, from enemy attacks. Avionic missions are starting on aircraft carrier, or occupied air fields on islands, to attack enemy territories, and capture them back. Gaining access to more captured islands, allows to improve economical aspect of the islands and to build more specialized airplanes. You need to take care about your own airplane, as loosing it can imply significant cost. With an extra option, to play on high difficulty, with only one life. Agile fighters are responsible to protect slow heavy bombers missions.Islands mechanics Islands are procedurally generated, so setup of island is different between games. Map size is limited to max 20x20 km. When island is cleared from the enemy population, you will be able to capture it, by landing on abandoned airfield and then repopulate it with own inhabitants. Captured islands can be rebuilt with simplistic management mechanics, from strategic map management. Towns and AA defenses will be possible to improve and upgrade. Population on the the islands play significant importance in the island's economy. Captured islands also unlock new upgrades components, for modification of airplanes.Airplane mechanics Friendly airplanes will be able to assist you in the air combat missions. Enemy airplanes will be produced and will be protecting own territories, as well as attacking occasionally opponents territories. Simplistic upgrade mechanics for airplanes, like engine power, bombs, rockets, machinegun, laser damage, Onboard ammunition and fuel is finite, and need to be taken care of. Once landed in the base, each next run will require to choose right equipment for next flight missions, to select i.e. bombs, rockets, torpedoes.Strategic Strategic part is related to organizing squadrons of airplanes and giving them mission order to fly into destination.  Also giving orders for bomber missions, to attack target.  You will need to assist and protect bombers with fighters. That can be done only when landed in the base.LoreIn the post apocalyptic world, decades after the human population was decimated by raging wars and pandemics, once prospering great nations, devolved merely into a glimpse of what was once recognized. Its place however wasn’t completely deserted, but instead it gave an opportunity to rise and been overtaken by rapidly evolving AI and altered humans into cyborgs.AI and cyborgs have established the Nano Nexus Syndicate, called NNS. Mostly collaborating with other large networks of NNS, evoliving this way into hyper brain. But even such a super organism is not without its own faults.On the other spectrum, human populations were creating their own closed enclaves. Not only conflicting with the cybernetic controlled world, but also constantly fighting among themselves, for now very scarce resources. Often forced to move, while leaving diesel and steam engines fumes behind, giving these groups the infamous nickname, Diesel Striders. In short DS.For those in DS who were in a better position and brave, or stupid enough, were trying to escape main continents and look for an oasis of freedom elsewhere. Large established groups of riders and looters wasn’t something unheard of. Scavenging for places to salvage what's possible, in a such scarce in resources world, looking and securing places to live in, was one of the human priorities.

        "About the Game": "Unfortunately due to geopolitical reason, production is postponed until further announcement.Welcome to AirFlow, where the vast expanse of the sky becomes your battleground! Prepare to embark on adrenaline-fueled adventures in epic aerial combat like never before. In AirFlow, you'll pilot powerful airplanes in intense battles for sky, land and sea, mastering the art of dodging enemy fire, while strategically outmaneuvering foes to claim dominance over the skies. Are you ready to take control and rule the heavens? Join the fray and soar to new heights in AirFlow!Planned Key FeaturesGame settings (As in pre alpha development stage, all features are subject to change) Game settings are in fantasy, futuristic, steampunk / dieselpunk postapocalyptic world, with procedurally generated islands. So each game is different experience.  Possible to play together in split-screen mode, in co-op, or as an opponents with family member, or friend on the same PC (none online).Your responsibilities as a pilot and squadron commander You are the pilot and squadron commander of Diesel Strider nation. You are responsible for building and managing your squadrons of fighters and bombers, to assist in avionic missions against Nano Nexus Syndicate. As the pilot with your assisting squadrons, you will be fighting against other airplanes, which are protecting enemy territory, as well as islands and naval defenses. You need to eliminate all enemies, while protecting own assets and aircraft carrier, from enemy attacks. Avionic missions are starting on aircraft carrier, or occupied air fields on islands, to attack enemy territories, and capture them back. Gaining access to more captured islands, allows to improve economical aspect of the islands and to build more specialized airplanes. You need to take care about your own airplane, as loosing it can imply significant cost. With an extra option, to play on high difficulty, with only one life. Agile fighters are responsible to protect slow heavy bombers missions.Islands mechanics Islands are procedurally generated, so setup of island is different between games. Map size is limited to max 20x20 km. When island is cleared from the enemy population, you will be able to capture it, by landing on abandoned airfield and then repopulate it with own inhabitants. Captured islands can be rebuilt with simplistic management mechanics, from strategic map management. Towns and AA defenses will be possible to improve and upgrade. Population on the the islands play significant importance in the island's economy. Captured islands also unlock new upgrades components, for modification of airplanes.Airplane mechanics Friendly airplanes will be able to assist you in the air combat missions. Enemy airplanes will be produced and will be protecting own territories, as well as attacking occasionally opponents territories. Simplistic upgrade mechanics for airplanes, like engine power, bombs, rockets, machinegun, laser damage, Onboard ammunition and fuel is finite, and need to be taken care of. Once landed in the base, each next run will require to choose right equipment for next flight missions, to select i.e. bombs, rockets, torpedoes.Strategic Strategic part is related to organizing squadrons of airplanes and giving them mission order to fly into destination.  Also giving orders for bomber missions, to attack target.  You will need to assist and protect bombers with fighters. That can be done only when landed in the base.LoreIn the post apocalyptic world, decades after the human population was decimated by raging wars and pandemics, once prospering great nations, devolved merely into a glimpse of what was once recognized. Its place however wasn’t completely deserted, but instead it gave an opportunity to rise and been overtaken by rapidly evolving AI and altered humans into cyborgs.AI and cyborgs have established the Nano Nexus Syndicate, called NNS. Mostly collaborating with other large networks of NNS, evoliving this way into hyper brain. But even such a super organism is not without its own faults.On the other spectrum, human populations were creating their own closed enclaves. Not only conflicting with the cybernetic controlled world, but also constantly fighting among themselves, for now very scarce resources. Often forced to move, while leaving diesel and steam engines fumes behind, giving these groups the infamous nickname, Diesel Striders. In short DS.For those in DS who were in a better position and brave, or stupid enough, were trying to escape main continents and look for an oasis of freedom elsewhere. Large established groups of riders and looters wasn’t something unheard of. Scavenging for places to salvage what's possible, in a such scarce in resources world, looking and securing places to live in, was one of the human priorities. And yet, continuously challenged by invigilating NNS.DS were attempting invading often ocean islands, as these were much easier to protect such establishments against NNS once fortified. It happened often however, that such places were well secured already and taking over wasn’t as that simple, as it may seem. Large forces had to be used, to penetrate fortifications and borders of NNS. That required a lot of resources alone, but was an opening for inventions and abilities to use, what was available on hand at given time.",

        "Detailed Description": "JOIN THE DISCORDAbout the GameEarth has witnessed a cataclysmic shift. Artificial intelligence, once mankind's most darling creations, has turned against its creator. As predicted by many, in the late 22nd century technology would rise against mankind, pitting humanity in a war with artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, no one expected humanity to lose. In this combat focused, turn-based strategy, players step into the shoes of one of the few remaining human commanders spearheading the resistance against invading AI forces.Your goal on this digital battleground is simple: complete domination.  Victory will require players to build out a command post where they will construct an army unique to their play style. Limited by a small bank of supplies and the resources around them, players will seek out and recapture finite enemy resources,  and completely remove your foe from this world.  Embracing the role of a commander, you have been given the reins to lead your forces to victory. As you navigate the battlefield you will need to strategically train, deploy, and maneuver an army of your liking on a procedurally generated battlefield.Command your army to remove enemy factions from this world.  Anything less than their complete annihilation is considered a loss.  You may have to think strategically  to maneuver your troops to victory.Build a command post and raise an army of your choosing.  The choices made constructing your battlements will offer a pivotal role in shaping your faction's destiny. As you discover and gather different resources players will unlock the ability to construct new buildings, each contributing uniquely to your strategic arsenal.  Expand your command by creating satellite cities using Rovers, or use Communication Towers to build beyond your starting radius; however, be careful, loss of communication has dire consequences.Allocate your resources to tactfully build and enhance your army. In this turn-based strategy you will need to master resource management in order to expand your command. As you engage in intense battles, cunning resource allocation will likely be the key to overpowering invading forces.Your ability to adapt is a necessity. You will need to continually reassess your defensive strategy as you defend your outpost against the endless onslaught of invading forces. Incorporating advanced technology and strategic retreats will become necessary to ensure the resilience of your command post against evolving challenges.The complete annihilation of your rival is a necessity to eliminate the looming threat of their future invasion. Remember, utter destruction is the key to ensuring your faction's survival.Every choice in your journey will be a calculated maneuver in this relentless war for supremacy, where the value of human life and the pursuit of technological domination are in stark contrast.

        "Detailed Description": "Greta Tanner died in her sleep last night.The doctors don’t know what to think. Sure, Greta was old, but not old enough to die without an apparent cause. She didn’t take pills, had no medical problems, and had no recent surgeries.Winter creeps into the small town of Trenton, Alaska. The roads are blocked with snow, and the wind carries an icy dagger.Dr. Grayson, the town’s new resident doctor, examines Greta's corpse. Some bruising. Slight burn marks on her legs – it could be frostbite. Hidden under Greta’s hair are five crescent-shaped wounds. None are severe enough to have been the cause of death, but the marks are fresh and bloody. There has to be a connection.Was Greta murdered? Or is there something else going on in Trenton? Some people in town have been acting weird, and a strange song is singing in the wind. Or is that just madness?Dr. Grayson must find whatever killed Greta Tanner and stop it from killing anyone else.The Sleeping Sickness is an interactive short story that allows the player to guide the main character's actions.Each day, the player chooses where Grayson investigates. The player’s choices will lock and unlock future locations, change dialogue, and alter the story. Choices matter in The Sleeping Sickness.While The Sleeping Sickness includes sounds, graphics, and interactive sections, it focuses on the story.The game is designed to play like a choose-your-own-adventure book and is an excellent choice for horror fans, avid readers, and lovers of creepy pastas. Each playthrough lasts 45 – 60 minutes and covers ~9,000 words. The entire story is approximately 31,000 words (roughly the length of Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck).Each playthrough will feel like a complete short story altered by the player’s choices. However, multiple read-throughs will be required to uncover the entire mystery.The Sleeping Sickness has six possible endings. Will you experience them all? Will you solve the mystery? Will you cure the sleeping sickness?",

There’s a hotel here where I work as a live-in cleaner—or at least, that’s my day job.By night, I suffer from chronic insomnia with just one cure: killing people. So I moonlight as a yakuza bigwig’s pet killer, waiting for him to toss me a bone and order a hit so I can sleep. Might sound like a fine line to walk, but my life’s pretty quiet. Pretty stable.Until I meet this girl, Azami. Defeating her got me a night of sleep so peaceful, I’ve been mulling over the idea of keeping her around. Thing is, my boss wants her dead, and if I bite the hand that feeds me, there’s my quiet, stable life out the door...CHARACTERSAzamiMarie KedaA mysterious girl who happens to visit the hotel the protagonist lives in. A cheerful and carefree young woman with an ever-present shadow, she ends up being hunted by the yakuza after a client dies on her.Haruhiko NireNetoru IrakusaAn elite detective from Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department’s First Detective Division who wanders Kabukicho, seemingly in search of something, even though his beat is actually East Shinjuku. While he may look kind, he’s a shrewd man who knows not just judo and kendo but various other practical martial arts as well.Sayuki UgaiRen KurenoA detective from East Shinjuku’s Detective Department Section 4 who’s lost any shred of morals or sense of duty. With her propensity for violence and greed, it’s no surprise she’s in the pocket of the Aoike Gathering who rule Kabukicho’s underbelly.Mirei BesshoMurasaki FujinoA brash and intelligent but stubborn young woman. She met the protagonist in Kabukicho and became fast friends with Azami.Yun Shi GuJimu KyariThe owner of an illegal business in Kabukicho. When he was young, he was the leader of a group of hot-blooded Shanghainese militants. Now he has been reduced to scraping together a living under the watchful eyes of the yakuza and the police, yet this does nothing to deter him from sticking it out in Kabukicho.Li Jian RongYukine TakaneThe elderly driver for Yun’s illegal business. Being a warm and sincere man who’s well-liked by the ladies he chauffeurs belies the fact that he was once the boss of Yun and a legendary Chinese gang who exercised power over Kabukicho.Lady DharmaMako AyaneA wheelchair-bound, limbless mass murderer who has weapons stowed within her prosthetic legs. Her modified wheelchair tops out at 50 KPH, allowing her to hunt her prey to the ends of the earth.

Controls are easy to pick up, customizable, and allow tight movements. The worldmap has many paths including secret ones. Play through each biome in the way you like!Immerse yourself in tranquil pixel art environments, and meet colorful and cute characters and enemies. Look out for secrets! Find each level's stars to unlock secret harder levels and shortcuts. Change your character's appearance and style with all the pearls you've collected. Challenge yourself by going for better times in each level. Some say deep down at the bottom of the ocean lies a magic pearl that grants wishes... Maybe this would simplify your task. But in the meantime, there's golden trash to take out!",

        "Detailed Description": "Taxing puzzles meet challenging platforming!In Blockhead, you take control of various blocks and move them around to solve puzzles. Many blocks can move left, move right and jump, but others have different restrictions and mechanics that you'll need to deal with. You'll need a combination of brains and skill to beat all 50 levels!Solve puzzles!The goal of each level is to transport certain blocks to their targets, elsewhere in the level. That won't be easy - you'll have to move other blocks out of the way, use them as stepping stones, or maybe create even more complex structures that you can use to reach your goal. Different blocks have different physics and controls that you can use to your advantage!Tricky platforming!In several levels, figuring out the solution is only half the challenge - you'll still need to pull it off! You'll often need to make some long and carefully-timed jumps, so make sure you don't fall and lose your progress. And keep an eye on the timer - if it runs out, the level will reset!Make your own!The built-in level editor allows you to create up to 5 levels of your own to challenge your friends! Levels are stored as simple, lightweight files that can be easily shared. See what devious challenges you can come up with!Completely free!Blockhead was originally made as a college project back in 2009-2010. This is a remastered version with improved graphics, better controls, and even music from other school and college projects! Of course we're not going to charge money for that - it's yours to enjoy for free!",

Meet thousands of captains who trade, loot, explore, and fight for dominance over islands and valuable resources in an open world. Сhoose who you will become in this story. Will you be a nameless captain whose shipwreck rots on the shore? Or a legend whose name commands respect among allies and fear among enemies? The Captain's Journey Begins Here Start your journey on a modest schooner and level up as far as the legends go: a 100-gun first-rate ship.  The game features over 50 sailing ships from the 16th to 19th centuries: schooners, galleons, brigantines, frigates, and ships of the line. Each can be upgraded and customized: you can repaint the hull, decorate the masts with flags, and change the design and fabric of the sails. Open World Explore the open world and sail beyond the map into the Boundless Sea. Who knows what secrets await you there? With enough gold, you can even afford a private island. It's a nice place to repair your fleet and store resources brought by your servants from mines and manufacturers. Game Economy Money is the lifeblood of war. How to earn them? This decision is yours to make. \t●  Love to pick fights? Board merchant ships and exchange their holds for gold in the ports.  \t●  Feeling like a trader? Set up a production chain. Process raw resources into goods and sell them to other players on the exchange.  \t●  Want to see the world? Join reselling and transportation. Tobacco and winemaking are abundant on the southern islands. The freezing North has none of these, but it has iron to sell to make cannons in southern ports.  \t●  Looking for ways to relax? Load fishing gear into your hold and head out in search of fish shoals. Fish is food for your crew and a great way to earn money.  Team Play A lone sea wolf is a dead sea wolf. Invite your friends to the game and form a squadron to defend against pirate attacks. Or, if you prefer to strike fear—become pirates yourselves. Looking for epic battles with seasoned players? Join a guild! This is where the real game begins: port battles, team tactics, strategy, intrigues, and diplomacy – we’ve got you covered.

We love that about them! It didn’t make sense to just put cats, have you noticed how different they can be and how many amazing stories they hide?If you want your cat to be IN the game you can do it through this link: If you're a shelter or any other cat helping facility, you can write to us at visitcatcelona@gmail.com and we'll be very glad to help you!Barcelona offers tons of amazing places, some of them sure you have already heard about, but others we hope will surprise you.Playing this game, you’ll be able to play out and in well-known spaces like Sagrada Familia or Parc Güell (yes, we love Gaudí!), but you’ll also get to discover some hidden gems like Poblenou’s graveyard or Catalonia's library. And what about sound? Oh, sound is so amazing and powerful!We’ve teamed up with Dash Obradors and got some help from one of our most admired sound makers (name to come!) to create a perfect environment for you to play, have fun but not stress at all.Barcelona has its own sounds, and we wanted to respect that inside the buildings, so go step in and discover everything!Cats don’t differentiate. Sure, they judge, but they love with no exceptions.We needed to respect that, and we’ve created an additional mode for neurodivergent people, and we’ve been formed and helped by accessibility experts so we don’t leave anyone out.That’s also why you can get the game in tons of different languages, meowing is universal, and so are we!Being a stray isn't an easy thing, and this is why this game donates a 5% of every sale to a shelter in Barcelona and promotes the visibility of other shelters all over the world.

        "Detailed Description": "Create vehicles in real-time using an intuitive node-based approach. Fine tune suspension geometry and drivetrain characteristics to create an unique driving experience. Exhibition of Speed is a racing game designed with modders and content creators in mind, where creating and modifying vehicles do not require messing around with extensive, complex and undocumented configuration files.The foundation of the multi-body vehicle simulation engine is designed from the ground up to support all kinds of wheeled vehicles and drivetrain configurations. The flexibility of the simulation is explored through nodes, which are the building blocks of every vehicle. Nodes of different types can be arranged and connected together to form a graph which describes the vehicle you want. As the graph is modified it gets evaluated and the results are reflected immediately on the vehicle being built. The vehicle can be driven while it's being formed and it may be saved and shared with others.The dynamic physical tire model ensures realistic driving behavior and detailed force feedback on the steering wheel. It is capable of producing effects such as camber thrust and relaxation length, which are usually only present in the most advanced racing simulators.In the upcoming multiplayer mode, you'll be able to join online races against other players with your custom car and put it to the test. Other players will be able to see your creation but it's up to you to prove it's the best car in the grid!As the game evolves, more types of suspensions, tires, engines, transmissions and all-wheel-drive systems will become available, enabling a greater variety of wheeled vehicles to be built.",
