        "Detailed Description": "Field of Glory II Medieval is a turn-based tactical game set in the High Middle Ages from 1040 AD to 1270 AD. This was the heyday of the mounted knight. Armoured from head to toe by the later 12th century, European knights rode heavy horses in tight formation, and delivered a devastating charge with couched lances. Major themes of the period include the struggles of the Kings of France against the Kings of England and the German Emperors, the English wars of conquest or attempted conquest against the Welsh, Scots and Irish, the Baltic Crusades and the Mongol invasion of Eastern Europe. With dynastic struggles and rebellions by powerful nobles thrown into the mix, Europe was in an almost constant state of war. Field of Glory II Medieval allows you to take command of the armies of the Anglo-Saxons and Normans, post-conquest England, France, Germany, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, the Low Countries, the Free Cantons, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Bohemia, Poland, the Teutonic Knights, the pagan Old Prussians and Lithuanians, Russia, Hungary, the Cumans, Volga Bulgars and Mongols in an endless variety of battles and campaigns set in 11th-13th century North and Central Europe. Lead your chosen army and its named generals to victory in set-piece historical battles or what-if custom battle situations against an AI or human opponent. Choose your forces from historically accurate orders of battle allowing all of the options and variations that would be available to a real general of that nation at any date during the era. Field of Glory II Medieval has more than 100 beautiful and historically accurate fully animated troop units, each with multiple variations to bring out the colour and variety of the era. Watch the swords flash and the arrows fly! Count the cost of victory or defeat as bodies litter the battlefield. Field of Glory II Medieval has a campaign system that concentrates on the battles, and allows real strategic decisions without time spent moving armies around a strategic map. Each battle is vital to your progress. Your army will gain experience and elan as it goes from victory to victory against your enemies and their allies. There are four historically-based campaigns covering major conflicts of the era: The Angevin Empire, The Northern Crusades, Alexander Nevsky and the Mongol Invasions. There is also a sandbox campaign system that allows you to lead any nation (and their historical allies) against any other nation (and their allies) – giving thousands of permutations. Victory will require determination and tactical mastery. Accurate simulation of battle in the High Middle Ages. 29 nations and factions covering North and Central Europe from 1040 AD to 1270 AD. 57 different army lists allowing historically realistic armies for each of these factions at different dates during the period. In addition armies can include contingents from historical allies. This gives tens of thousands of permutations. You will never run out of new matchups to try. More than 100 historically accurate units, built from fully animated 3D troop models. Historical scenarios covering key engagements of the period on an epic scale. These include Hastings 1066, Tinchebrai 1106, Trutina 1110, Crug Mawr 1136, The Standard (Northallerton) 1138, Steppes 1213, Bouvines 1214, Otepää 1217, Kalka River 1223, Bornhöved 1227, Lake Peipus 1242 and Kressenbrunn 1260. Custom Battle system allows unlimited “what-if” scenarios using historically realistic armies from carefully researched army lists, on realistic computer generated terrain maps. Armies covered include Anglo-Saxons, Normans, post-conquest English, French, Imperial and Feudal German, Lowland Scottish, Highland/Isles Scottish, North and South Welsh, Irish, Anglo-Irish, Low Countries, Free Cantons, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Bohemian, Polish, Teutonic Knights, Old Prussians, Lithuanians, Russians, Hungarians, Cumans, Volga Bulgars and Mongols. 12 selectable scenarios include: Open Battle, Enemy expecting Reinforcements, Own side expecting Reinforcements, Flank March, Rearguard, Advance Guard, Kill the King, Escort Baggage Train, Own Side Defending, Enemy Defending, Relieve Besieged Fortress, Enemy Relieve Besieged Fortress. Quick Battle mode allows you to quickly select from 65 pre-set matchups between historical opponents. Campaign mode allows you to play through historically-based campaign scenarios or “what-if” campaigns between any two opposing nations with thousands of permutations. Each victory increases the experience and elan of your core units. You can give each of them its own unique unit name. Quick to resolve strategic decisions allow you to go straight from one battle to the next without any delay. Random map generator produces an infinite variety of historically realistic battlefield maps for custom battles and campaigns. Classic turn-based, tile based gameplay. Easy to use interface, hard to master gameplay. Battles can range from a few units to as many as 80 units per side. Named generals who can influence combat and morale of units under their command. Single player and multiplayer battle modes. Effective AI makes sound tactical decisions. 6 difficulty levels allow the challenge to increase as you develop your battlefield skills. Numerous different unit organisations, combat capabilities and tactical doctrines allow full representation of tactical differences and developments. Mod friendly game system with built-in map editor. Multiplayer mode allows historical scenarios and “what-if” scenarios to be played by two players using Slitherine’s easy to use PBEM server.",

Can you survive international assassins? Can you stop an evil mastermind's nefarious plans? Can you avoid contracting an STD? Welcome to Phoenix Erupting, a visual novel brought to you by the people who played Police Quest IV and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. You are sent by your bosses to investigate an evil European megalomaniac with dreams of world domination or whatever. Charm, fight, and shag your way through exotic locales such as Latin America, Monte Carlo, lush volcanic islands, and Milton Keynes. A VISUAL NOVEL? Did you ever grow up reading ‘Choose Your Own Adventures’ books? Then you’re a nerd. So are we, and that’s why we made this game. The other reason we made this game is because it’s the genre of game that requires minimal programming and game design. But within those limitations anything can happen – you can catch a venereal disease, have something shoved up your arse, listen to a man going to the toilet, and literally get covered in shit – and that’s if you play the game well! There are well over 100 different decisions trees spread throughout the game – some of these decisions not affecting the game at all, while others can result in an untimely death. This game has 12 different final endings giving the game great replay value. Another feature that gives this game great replay value is the ‘skip dialogue’ button, which makes the game go super-fast, although you might have no idea what’s happening! A “COMEDY” “GAME” This game is so funny you’ll not only piss your own pants, but also other people’s pants as well! This side-splitting adventure will have you laughing non-stop at jokes about poop, drugs, murder, women, alcoholism, foreigners, and dead children. This game also contains reference humour and meta gags so you can feel good about how clever you are. Because you get to choose how the story progresses it’s your fault if you don’t find this game funny. If you’d made the right choices this game would’ve been hilarious – we promise. [Note: If you find our attempt at humour is of the ‘so bad it’s good’ variety, then that was our intention all along] A BUNCH OF COLOURFUL CHARACTERS Brilliantly written characters make this world come alive. Be careful how you interact with people, as your reputation with certain characters can affect how the story plays out and which story branches you end up going down. Sometimes having a good or bad reputation might make the game more interesting. Or more tedious and boring. It might even be the difference between saving the Earth and being buried under 6-feet of it. Additionally, there are many more colourful secondary characters to meet, several of whom you can kick in the balls!",

Because you get to choose how the story progresses it’s your fault if you don’t find this game funny. If you’d made the right choices this game would’ve been hilarious – we promise. [Note: If you find our attempt at humour is of the ‘so bad it’s good’ variety, then that was our intention all along] A BUNCH OF COLOURFUL CHARACTERS Brilliantly written characters make this world come alive. Be careful how you interact with people, as your reputation with certain characters can affect how the story plays out and which story branches you end up going down. Sometimes having a good or bad reputation might make the game more interesting. Or more tedious and boring. It might even be the difference between saving the Earth and being buried under 6-feet of it. Additionally, there are many more colourful secondary characters to meet, several of whom you can kick in the balls!",

        "Detailed Description": "GAMEPLAY FEATURES 15+ hours of story A branching visual novel Full Japanese voice acting by seasoned professionals STORY Going on my big sister’s recommendation, I’ve transferred to Ainoshima Academy! With summer break over, a new semester of fall events awaits. There’s the annual academy festival, the sports meet—the list goes on! As I walk to class on my first day, my heart races in anticipation at what my new campus life will be like. That is, until students start approaching me a short distance from the campus gate… You see, Ainoshima Academy has two student councils that are always vying against each other. Here, let me break it down for you real quick: Gekka Council: Steeped in history and tradition, Gekka is as old as the academy itself. Its supporters wear uniforms featuring flowing, dark-green skirts for added noblesse. Gekka President Alicetia : “Join Gekka… Let’s be friends…” Tendo Council: Tendo is a new student council that was formed after Gekka. Its supporters prefer a dress style that incorporates the latest in uniform chic, including burgundy bolero jackets, pleated miniskirts, and neckties. Tendo President Usagi : “Join Tendo—let’s get this academy inspired!” Meanwhile, various student associations have been involved in a proxy war, with the sports teams supporting Gekka and the liberal arts clubs backing Tendo. Before I transferred, the student vote was split evenly between them, which means my vote will be the one that decides who gets the majority! Word has it that a similar deadlock happened six years ago, and it was a transfer student who broke it. Coincidence, huh? Anyway, as you can imagine, since day one of me moving here, neither faction will give me a moment’s peace! This isn’t how my sister said it would be at all…?! Gekka Vice President Mashiro : “I wish the sports jocks and liberal arts gang could just get along.” Tendo Secretary Tateha : “With your vote, something might actually change around here.” I was planning to live my new campus life in peace, but as the academy’s 777th student, the entire student population is watching my every move. Being 777 might sound like the jackpot, but the way things are going, I just might be the unluckiest guy here… With two student councils to deal with, plus the ongoing proxy war, my new life at Ainoshima Academy is already off to a challenging start! CHARACTER Alicetia Wallenberg Kezouji (Voice: Yuuka Kotorii) The president of the Gekka Council and in same year as the protagonist. As the daughter of a powerful family, she had her position thrust upon her, but as an individual she’s very awkward in front of people. She tries her best to support everyone, but between her naturally evil-looking eyes and her poor communication skills, the general consensus is that annoying her is a great way to risk getting cursed. “If I were better at communicating, I wonder if I would have more friends...” Usagi Tsukiyono (Voice: Choco Moca) As a former model-turned-idol, she won the Tendo presidency by the largest margin in school history. Despite her burgeoning fame, she doesn’t act superior, and she performs her council duties so effectively that men and women alike seem to flock to support her. ...Or that’s how it looks on the face of things. Underneath, she’s a hard worker who manages her image carefully and manipulates everything around her with skill. She loves ramen and often goes out in disguise to sample the town’s various noodle-based offerings. “Thanks, everybody! Okay, we can do one little encore♪” Mashiro Kuryu (Voice: Suzu Yuki) A year below the protagonist, this first-year student is already the vice president of the prestigious Gekka Council. Effortlessly capable, she can take care of almost any issue that arises, preparing documents, pouring tea, and speaking in stead of the mushy-mouthed Alicetia. Some forward-thinking supporters are already calling her the next Gekka president. Her personal hobbies include gardening, and she can often be found taking care of the flowers tucked away in a corner behind the school building. “Might I interest you in another cup of tea?” Tateha Tatebayashi (Voice: Hana Akino) The secretary of the Tendo Council is also the protagonist’s classmate. Bright, cheerful, and big-sisterly, she acts as a social lubricant to ease the friction between Tendo’s more eccentric personages. Though she may seem almost overbearing at first glance, she actually has a difficult time saying no and tends to go with the flow most of the time. This only makes her all the more approachable, so she makes friends everywhere. In her own time, she often lends a hand to her uncle (or aunt?) who runs a certain café... “Welcome to Rapunzel—wait, no. I mean, welcome to the Tendo Council!” Anna Watanuki (Voice: Kiiro Tsukino) Another member of the protagonist’s class. With her perpetually lighthearted demeanor, she can come off as strange and a challenge to read. She splits her fashion between Gekka and Tendo uniforms according to her mood, making it hard to tell who she supports. The way she flaps and flits around has earned her the nickname “the bat.” “Hehehehe. Now things are getting interesting!”",
        "Short Description": "As new rivalries and old divisions threaten to split Ainoshima apart once again, only a new “Triple Seven” can restore peace once more! Torn between the machinations of the Liberal Arts and Sports factions, can our hero heal everyone's hearts—and steal just one?",

        "Detailed Description": "Heart of Muriet is a voxel fantasy 4X RTS with a unique take. Teaming up with Elves, Dwarfs, and Mages, you’ll need to build and manage settlements while researching powerful magic to overcome the enemy in tense, company-based warfare. Build and upgrade your bases with up to 40 different buildings and even more upgrades. Choose from 4 magic realms with a great selection of spells and a plethora of research options to boost the might of your heroic wizard and their army. Pick a clever strategy for your army, control your wizard and watch them win epic battles against your enemies. You can manage troop formations and workers with ease and without any stress. Gone are the days of dragging boxes on the battlefield, instead you control entire formations or all the workers at a specific base with a single click. Give your fighting formations special commands depending on the situation, or use your spellcasters to turn the tide of epic battles. Build up to 40 distinctive buildings, from barracks to research laboratories, siege workshops, and air academies to transportation portals. Upgrade them to recruit faster, increase your income or provide additional passive buffs for your troops and workers. Your spellcaster (Seneer) can excel in different magic schools (Fire, Arcane, Nature, and Water) while playing a mission and unlock new buildings, units, spells and other technology options through research. The Seneer is a unique and powerful unit that can teleport to bases and incarnate in army formations. They have access to a wide range of spells, including attacking, defending and strengthing the base mining. How you control and manage your Seneer can be pivotal to your success in a mission. Each mage allows you to specialise in one or more schools of magic during a mission. Magic schools currently have four levels. The highest level unlocks the most powerful spells and research for that school. Play at your own pace, stop the game anytime and think about your decisions. Manage your large army and its formation, select which unit and building types to attack, set flee parameters on the attack, or recall your troops when the battle seems lost. Heart of Muriet is a strategy game that puts you in control of everything. As Heart of Muriet grows, I plan to extend the map editor's functionality accordingly. At EA launch you can create levels, good-looking brushes, and interesting base layouts and share them with the community. The Seneer houses have gone to war with each other since the “Portal Conspiracy” . The council of 12 has disbanded, and a savage conflict over power and wealth has started. Lianam former leader of the council and head of the powerful House Othal has been killed. Her son Necelion survived and is now on a quest to reunite his family and the unity of the Seener. Procedural level generation and challenging AI opponents. Choose from a variety of wizards with vastly different skill sets. 20 different units and 40 buildings. Conquer ancient bases of NPC factions with abundant loot. Additional sub-quests and interesting map win conditions. Squads gain experience, level up, and improve your army. Map Editor supporting SteamWorkshop to share your maps with other players.

        "Detailed Description": "From a simple home to a mighty kingdom; explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate your opponent in this strategic pixel-art chess-like hex game using cards as your pieces and their abilities as your tools. As the saying goes; easy to learn, hard to master. Join Steam Discussions! - Talk with the Dev! - Talk with the community! - Share strategies, ideas, and thoughts! - Help shape this game's future with input! What to Expect: (EA) - Planned through Early Access Map Variety - Multiple Island maps made to test different strategies and mechanics. - More being added over time to challenge strategies and players' abilities to adapt. (EA) - A map editor! (EA) Card Variety - A large assortment of cards that are used together to form even stronger cards. - More being added over time to fulfill newer strategies and newer mechanics. (EA) Different Modes - Basic: The basic form of the game, where players take turns. - Timed: Similar to the basic mode, but players only have a set amount of time to complete their moves. (EA) - Expert: A mode that brings the game closer to the RTS genre; where cards have cooldowns before use. (EA) - Possibly more modes, or changes to the currently planned modes! (EA) Endless Replayability. - Where the difficulty is based on your opponents' strategies. Up to 4 Players [Local or Remote Play Together] - 4 for All - 1 vs 1 - 2 vs 2 - This was a 3 for All, but I just made an alliance, so now it's a 2 v 1. Monetization Method [EARLY ACCESS] As the game progresses in development, the price will rise; online being the major update that will more than likely double the game's price. But until then, the game will be at its lower price-point, with possibly a middle ground between online and the first build; the price only changing when a significant amount of new features and cards have been added, or if sales take off. If I start selling more though, I'll certainly add far more and do far more than I had initially planned for the beginning- particularly because if that happens, then I can focus completely on game development.

Join Steam Discussions! - Talk with the Dev! - Talk with the community! - Share strategies, ideas, and thoughts! - Help shape this game's future with input! What to Expect: (EA) - Planned through Early Access Map Variety - Multiple Island maps made to test different strategies and mechanics. - More being added over time to challenge strategies and players' abilities to adapt. (EA) - A map editor! (EA) Card Variety - A large assortment of cards that are used together to form even stronger cards. - More being added over time to fulfill newer strategies and newer mechanics. (EA) Different Modes - Basic: The basic form of the game, where players take turns. - Timed: Similar to the basic mode, but players only have a set amount of time to complete their moves. (EA) - Expert: A mode that brings the game closer to the RTS genre; where cards have cooldowns before use. (EA) - Possibly more modes, or changes to the currently planned modes! (EA) Endless Replayability. - Where the difficulty is based on your opponents' strategies. Up to 4 Players [Local or Remote Play Together] - 4 for All - 1 vs 1 - 2 vs 2 - This was a 3 for All, but I just made an alliance, so now it's a 2 v 1. Monetization Method [EARLY ACCESS] As the game progresses in development, the price will rise; online being the major update that will more than likely double the game's price. But until then, the game will be at its lower price-point, with possibly a middle ground between online and the first build; the price only changing when a significant amount of new features and cards have been added, or if sales take off. If I start selling more though, I'll certainly add far more and do far more than I had initially planned for the beginning- particularly because if that happens, then I can focus completely on game development. And since this is an industry I love, I would happily focus on it.

        "Detailed Description": "The game is about Marco Polo’s experience when visiting Hangzhou, China during the medieval period Marco Polo's book is a travelogue about Asia, which records the situation of many countries in Central Asia, West Asia, Southeast Asia and other regions, and its focus is on the narrative about China. Marco Polo has stayed in China for the longest time. His footprints are all over the Northwest, North China, Southwest and East China. In Travel, he described the inexhaustible wealth of China, the huge commercial city, the good transportation facilities, and the gorgeous palace buildings with a lot of chapters and passionate language. The second volume of Travel, which focuses on China, consists of 82 chapters and is very important throughout the book. There are many pages in this volume about Kublai and Beijing. At the beginning of the book, the people who were very surprised at the time were introduced: Emperors, kings, dukes, marquises, counts, knights and citizens, and all other people, no matter who they are, if you want to understand the differences between human races , To understand the differences between regions of the world, please read it or listen to someone reading this book! You will find that in this book, as described by Messi Marco Polo, we are clearly organized All the great and strange things in the major regions of the East-Greater Armenia, Persia, Tatar places, India, and many other countries. Marco Polo is a Venetian citizen, smart and noble, known as 'Mr. Million'. He has witnessed these things with his own eyes.... Anyone who reads or listens to this book should be convinced, because everything described here is true. Indeed, since God used him Since the creation of our ancestor Adam, to this day, there has never been anyone, Christians or pagans, Tatars or Indians, and people of other races, like this Hessian Mark, Know and examine so many and great anecdotes all over the world.... The story that Marco narrates is indeed as exciting as what this introduction says. He talked about the Great Khan Palace with gardens and man-made lakes, elephants loaded with silver harnesses and precious stones. He also talked about the various avenues above the surrounding ground and easy to drain; merchant ships flowed continuously every year on the Grand Canal; various ports berthed larger vessels than Europeans knew, and talked about the production of spices, silk, Some places of ginger, sugar, camphor, cotton, salt, saffron, sandalwood and porcelain. Marco also described all the fabled countries he visited and heard about when he escorted the Chinese princess to Persia-Singapore, Java, Sumatra, Ceylon, India, Socotra Island, Madagascar, Arabian Peninsula, San To Barr and Abyssinia. Everything in the book seems bizarre and exaggerated. Therefore, people called him Mr. Million because He always says one million and one million. In fact, he provided the most comprehensive and reliable information about China to Europeans in the mid-16th century. It is no accident that the title of this book is World Record. In fact, this work suddenly doubled the scope of Westerners' understanding of the world. Marco Polo, like Columbus two centuries later, opened up a whole new world for his contemporaries. Indeed, it is the fascinating scene he described about China and the Spice Islands that summoned great explorers to search for a sea route directly after the Muslims blocked the road on the land. Heaven on Earth famous Italian traveler Mark Polo once described Hangzhou in his impression: This is the most beautiful and charming city in the world, it makes people feel that they are in heaven. This is a town located in Hangzhou, where you can experience what is picturesque. The architecture of the town takes the pursuit of the realm of nature, Although it is made by people, it is natural as the ultimate and ultimate goal of aesthetic appeal.The garden uses stacked stones, piles of mountains, water management, etc. to reflect the natural beauty to the greatest extent. The game-shooting part of the game is even more exemplified by Marco Polo’s description: “There are many kinds of prey here, such as yellow deer, hare, and pheasants, partridges like pheasants, ordinary poultry, and more ducks and geese. . In the game, you can use the bow and arrow to shoot the animals you see. In addition, there are games for fishing and writing brushes; fishing is a relatively old harpoon tool. There are three mini-games in this game, shooting, fishing, and writing brush characters; points will be accumulated during the game. When a certain score is reached, you will be able to use bows and harpoons in the game. Otherwise, you can only use the specified props in the specified level.

Explore four wildly different areas as you fight strange enemies, acquire upgrades which change how you traverse the station and discover what happened to the crew of the CEREMOS as you try to escape. Run, jump and shoot your way through CEREMOS. Many parts of the station are inaccessible until the right ability or weapon is found; thorough exploration of the station’s four areas is essential to escape! Every upgrade changes how you tackle both combat and exploration. Dynamic bosses will test both your platforming and aiming skills as you make your way through the station.

        "Detailed Description": "Critterland is a fast-paced 2D real-time strategy (RTS) game that pits you against the forces of nature. Spawn, adapt, and amass your army of plants, herbivores, and carnivores, discovering new strategies and ecological dynamics. in Critterland, you design and place critters of various species, and select adaptations for those critters as you build and place each critter in the style of a role-playing game. Each critter reproduces, creating new lineages that interact with the others in the world. Your goal is to find synergies between your species that achieve gameplay objectives. Play Modes Critterland has two play modes: Campaign Sandbox The Critterland campaign is a sequence of increasingly complex puzzle-like levels where you must discover synergies between species to achieve objectives in the world, such as surviving an onslaught of invasive species or living through an apocalyptic volcano eruption. Critters There are several types of critters: Plants Herbivores Decomposers Carnivores Each category of critters (plants, herbivores, decomposers, and carnivores) has a unique set of adaptations that you design so that each species offers different gameplay dynamics. For example, decomposers eat dead critters, while plants can be upgraded to eat other critters. Adaptations Use the Critter builder to select adaptations for individual Critters and place them on the map, where they will spontaneously move and interact with other critters. Once you have a feel for the gameplay dynamics, you can experiment with the sandbox mode to find even stranger ecological equilibria. Critters eat each other according to the familiar food chain. However, you can invert this food chain in certain ways, such as giving a plant lineage the Carnivorous adaptation to turn the tables on the herbivores! As critters digest, they leave behind poop. If you design critters that can eat poop, then wonderful synergies may emerge. Each category of critters (plants, herbivores, and carnivores) has a unique set of adaptations. For example, herbivores can have the Assertive adaptation which gives them the ability to push away Carnivores seeking to eat them. Likewise, plants can have Drifting Seeds , enabling them to reproduce across the land beyond the reach of the landlubbers who strive to eat them. The in-game adaptation wheel offers even more choices and specializations of each adaptation. Experiment and see which combos you enjoy most! Music Critterland's campaign offers an atmospheric original soundtrack (OST), also available on Steam. Fact If nothing else, remember this: wombats poop cubes.",

        "Detailed Description": "To stay up to date with the development of Becloudead, look for us on Facebook or Twitter under Headbang Games. Becloudead is a horror story driven, hack and slash cinematic platformer, set in a post-apocalyptic world plagued by a zombie virus. Design The game world and level design in Becloudead are tailored around the story, featuring unique designs and locations to explore. Becloudead features pixel art hand traced rotoscoped character animations, detailed layered backgrounds and foregrounds, using parallax to give the scenes more 3D depth with a 2D design. Becloudead features full screen frame by frame hand drawn and rotoscoped cutscenes. The Virus The virus in Becloudead comes with some nasty side effects, one of them being nightmares... horrific, gruesome and potentially lethal nightmares. The game-world in Becloudead is split into two: The real world The majority of the world will be opened for traveling and revisiting areas (some backtracking will be required, when new items/abilities are acquired). On your path you will be fighting zombies, local deadly wildlife and more... The nightmare world These will be isolated levels, each with it's own theme set around a holiday (Xmas, Easter, Halloween, etc) and with a holiday themed boss battle at the end. The nightmare opposed to the real world are not always logical or straightforward, they are more creepy and will feature additional fantasy like enemies. Cinematic Platformer The core mechanic of the game. The platforming in Becloudead is more limited to human abilities as you expect from a cinematic platformer, that includes movement speed, jumping height, taking fall damage, use of inertia and more. In Becloudead the player can perform a variety of unique actions to navigate and interact with the environment, with over 100 unique player animations. Hack and Slash The majority of the combat in Becloudead will be closed ranged with cold weapons such as a knife, a crowbar, a sledge hammer, a spear, more TBD. Your go-to personal weapon is the knife, the knife is the only one handed weapon you have and it can be used in situations where two handed weapons are not practical to use. The knife is also used underwater, with 6 different angles of attacking. Combos There are a few different ways to attack in Becloudead. The main attack is a 4 hits combo with specific input timing. Each weapon has 4 unique combo moves, where the first two deal x1 damage, the third x1.5 damage and inflicts other attributes (such as cutting off arms of zombies with any sharp weapon) and the 4th hit deal x2 damage and consider a finish move, this one also has a special attribute depending on the weapons (such as taking of a zombie head with sharp weapon or bashing it with the hammer). Each weapons comes with it’s own combo slot. You can edit your own combos, selecting a different weapon for each of the combo hits. Additional weapon features Each weapon features a unique charged attack (3 seconds charging) that inflicts more damage and has more range, and also an air attack. Each weapon has a tool attribute, for example, using the crowbar to break chained locks, using the hammer to smash weak walls/floors spots, etc. Puzzles You will also need to solve some, such as: Finding your way through maze-like areas, finding items and using them where needed, interacting with scene objects, manipulating the environment to clear or create a path, finding codes to doors and more... Story On October 10th, 2062, two years into a zombie apocalypse, Ben woke up to the sounds of his house tumbling down. Little does he know about the crazy and fateful day awaiting him. You are Ben Campbell, a former head of security of a private marine research company, now a survivor.

        "About the Game": "When the alien craft entered Earth’s solar system, the human race was alive with excitement. However, when it was accidentally fired upon, the consequences were dire. In a burst of electromagnetic energy, the entire planet Earth disappeared, leaving its gravity well and the moon behind. In this open world, sci-fi role-playing game, you are part of the Moon base team on a desperate mission to bring Earth back. You must assemble and equip your crew, customize your ship and set out in search of unique parts to create the Centauri Drive, a device your team hopes will reverse the electromagnetic phenomenon that swallowed Earth. Travel between dozens of stars, harvest resources to repair and upgrade your equipment, meet and negotiate with friendly (and hostile) aliens, and do whatever it takes to stay alive and bring Earth back.

The path is set, but the gates have to be opened, and the guardians defeated. Safe journey to you ! Travel through the Abyss : Open your way through the darkness, ride along the old ruins and activate the seized mechanisms in the roots to awaken the abyss. Fight the Guardians : To defeat the monsters of the Abyss, you will need more than mere brute strength. Observe them and shoot their shell to weaken them ! It's the only way to defeat them! Creator note : PFFF ! Making that kind of game was a real thrill !... and a hell of workload ! Seeing this very personal universe take life is quite strange but, wow! I’m so happy with it! Creating this game allowed me to improve drastically. And even if the result isn’t perfect yet, i can tell that I’ve come a long way! Special thanks to my friend Emmanuel (FractalStrike) for the musics, without which the game would clearly not have the same atmosphere! I really hope you’ll enjoy playing this game ! Bye !

        "About the Game": "Overview : Arabel is a 3D adventure game telling the story of a lost knight, searching her way out of the strange and twisted lands of the Abyss. The path is set, but the gates have to be opened, and the guardians defeated. Safe journey to you ! Travel through the Abyss : Open your way through the darkness, ride along the old ruins and activate the seized mechanisms in the roots to awaken the abyss. Fight the Guardians : To defeat the monsters of the Abyss, you will need more than mere brute strength. Observe them and shoot their shell to weaken them ! It's the only way to defeat them! Creator note : PFFF ! Making that kind of game was a real thrill !... and a hell of workload ! Seeing this very personal universe take life is quite strange but, wow! I’m so happy with it! Creating this game allowed me to improve drastically. And even if the result isn’t perfect yet, i can tell that I’ve come a long way! Special thanks to my friend Emmanuel (FractalStrike) for the musics, without which the game would clearly not have the same atmosphere! I really hope you’ll enjoy playing this game ! Bye !

The main goal of the series is to show the drama of individuals in the face of terrifying events. Play as Karen, a calculated assassin on the hunt for a mysterious girl in the remote town of Grey Ville. As you inch closer to finding your target, you will become more and more entangled in the social network of the tight-knit small-town community and uncover the secrets held close to the chest by the locals.

Although she tries with all her might to please her bosses, they treat her as a useful tool, nothing more. Karen, an admirer of order, will be forced to face the chaos that will haunt a sleepy town. Fate will test her ability to establish relationships and the cold rules she has created to keep her loved ones away from herself in order not to hurt them. The agent’s main motivation will be to look for the mysterious Jane, the girl who seems to be spreading the mysterious virus. A mysterious scientist will appear among the suspects. The owner of the local gas station, Bob, will play an important role. How will the fate of the characters turn out? Will Grey Ville be saved or exterminated?",

        "Detailed Description": "SPECIAL MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPER Thanks for buying my game! I've added FREE DLC - Cassius (Developer) About the Game A High-Octane Thrill Ride Get ready to take on the role of the ultimate sci-fi hover taxi driver in this fast-paced adventure! Experience heart-pumping action as you race against the clock in a vibrant, futuristic city inspired by The Fifth Element, with arcade-style gameplay reminiscent of Crazy Taxi. This pulse-pounding ride will have you on the edge of your seat. As you speed through the narrow, vibrant skyways, you'll encounter a cast of hilarious and chatty pedestrians, as well as impatient and over-the-top passengers. Every moment counts in this high-stakes all-or-nothing game. Rise to the challenge and come out on top! Gameplay is Simple - Mastering this Game Won't Be! With an “easy” setting and three different game play modes to choose from, you'll have plenty of opportunities to improve your skills and test your limits. Most players can master the controls for a hover taxi in under one hour of intense gameplay and be able to confidently navigate the city streets. Get ready to accept the challenge, take the wheel, and show off your skills as you become a top player in this fast-paced adventure! Different Ways to Play In regular mode, strategize to pick up and drop off passengers in efficient ways, maximizing your earnings and extending your game time and career. In Challenge mode, you'll face increasingly difficult challenges as you deliver passengers sequentially to level up. In Free Roam mode, you'll be able to explore the city with no time limits or passenger pickups, discovering hidden shortcuts and other secrets as you go. Gameplay Prepare for action as you climb into your taxi and start picking up fares from towering skyscrapers. You'll need to deliver your passengers as fast as possible to keep your job and earn bonus time, but don't let your guard down – you never know what obstacles and challenges you might face on the Skyways. Navigate through the city and find hidden customers with the help of your NavCom AI. Once you've mastered the city, take the fast lane by navigating narrow back alleys and use your Hyper Boost to blast through skyway traffic at breakneck speeds of up to 250mph. With over 50 floors to explore, this video game is sure to keep you engaged and on the edge of your seat. MiLE HiGH TAXi is like The Fifth Element meets Crazy Taxi. Deliver Zany Passengers, Dodge Mile-High Skyscrapers, and Blabbermouth Pedestrians in a Fast-Paced Race Against Time. Here are some of the games I'm told are either similar, or that I took some inspiration from: Crazy Taxi, Taxi Chaos, CloudPunk, CyberPunk 2077 (I'm not sure why?), Forza, Grand Theft Auto (maybe because driving into people?), BeamNG.drive, the Coruscant scene from Star Wars, Midnight Club 3 (I'm guessing because of the architecture of the buildings), and last but not least is Taxi Simulator.

        "Detailed Description": "Airline Technician is a game about the important job of Airport Line Technicians. Their responsibilities include coordinating ramp operations and aircraft movement via radio, fueling, towing aircraft, operating ground support equipment, reporting malfunctions and keeping the airport operational. Line Technician Airport line technicians have many job responsibilities but their main goal is to make sure aircraft is safe for flying. Line technicians perform routine checks and ensure there's enough fuel for the next flight. Airport line technicians must interact with airport staff and passengers to make sure everything is safe and secure for departures and arrivals. Direct Aircraft An airport line technician is responsible for guiding, towing, parking, greeting and organizing aircraft that's arriving or departing from an airport gate or ramp. They never pilot aircraft but they often tow planes to appropriate flight areas, gates and hangars. A technician must also know how to direct pilots using aviation hand signals. Maintenance and Fuel A line technician monitors fuel levels, oil levels, performs quality control checks and maintenance to make sure flying is handled safely and efficiently. He's also reporting any visible damage to aircraft and checking aircraft lights and water supplies. Terminals Airport line technicians help with the upkeep of terminals, hangars and airport grounds. They make sure terminals are litter-free, clean, safe and organized. Technicians also maintain aircraft hangars so planes can be parked or stored over night or for longer periods of time. During bad weather, line technicians help maintain walkways and steps so passengers have a safe route to and from aircraft and they also help de-ice aircraft. They must immediately report suspicious activity in terminals, including unattended baggage, to security. Customer Service Part of a line technicians job is to help with customer service needs. For example, line technicians often handle luggage, provide transportation between gates or terminals, give passengers directions, interact with lobby attendants, converse with pilots and greet passengers who are entering or exiting terminals. Line technicians must have a kind and friendly disposition that makes passengers feel welcome, safe and comfortable with the airport facilities, staff and aircraft.",

You can use this to improve your skills. Add manual mode, can be played as a SLG game. ======================== == The Author's Statement == ======================== This game was created by me in April 2020, after I returned to Wuhan.China to work alone, I was bored at home after get off work and decided to code it. The game code was developed by me during the first month of get off work and weekends. Because it's my first time to use the Unity, and I usually use C++ language, It cost lots of time to learn C# and Unity without pointers. At the most difficult time, it takes nearly a weekend to solve one problem. Such as camera, coordinate system, generation Unity object by code and so on. After 1 month I completed the code, and then I started draw ui, It took a week and I still not finish to drawing a pixel character that I was satisfied with, So I asked someone to help with the drawing, Then June to July passed, My’s company started to work overtime on 995 and single and double breaks, More workload than usual came to me, So I focus on work, the development of the game basically stopped, and at the same time synchronization of other art resources. Until August, after the company’s heavy work eased, the art resources were still not finished, I asked the guy and he said wait for a few days always. So I decide to do it by myself. By looking for Unity’s resources, I can barely find the most suitable resources to use ourselves and adjust and then code development. In addition, i get my child back home in Wuhan, and my personal available time was shorter. Until now, in October, all the art and music resources were finally developed. In line with the beginning and the end, although I am not satisfied with the art of this game, But still release the game, it was giving an explanation to myself. ============= == In the end == ============= This is not a beautiful game, but I hope this game can make you to think it is an interesting game. This studio is my temporary name. All the members of the studio are actually only me alone. I like development, and I like to develop games. I know that the art resources of this game is really bad. I will change it if i can get or made the handsome resources. Many ideas have not yet been realized. This version is currently the first version, I will continue to update new content. The locale file can be modified for other languages by customize. You can email me if you hane any questions.",

        "Detailed Description": "Pecaminosa blends the charm of a pixel art ARPG with the stifling atmosphere of film noir. It’s like mixing The Legend of Zelda with Touch of Evil — you haven’t seen and played anything like it! Interrogate suspects, explore a city dominated by crime and sin, and never hesitate to use your fists and guns. These are hard times in Pecaminosa. Customize your character's equipment and improve your skill set by distributing experience points among the four parameters of the L.I.F.E. system: Luck, Intelligence, Force and Endurance. Play Blackjack to earn extra money, visit the liquor store, socialize with the scum, visit the police station and the brothel, in addition to other venues recreated with great graphic detail… and don't trust anyone. There’s a bullet with your name on it, and it’s eager to meet you. Welcome to Pecaminosa, a border city between the United States and Mexico where gambling, corruption and crime reign in its dusty streets. A home for all those who live outside the law... and for our protagonist, John Souza, a former detective, a man who lived through better times before finding comfort at the bottom of the bottle. John would never have suspected that his next job was going to come at the hands of a ghost. Charlie's Two Angels specter appears to him with a task: to capture his former associates in order to achieve redemption for their sins and be able to pass through the gates of Heaven. To hunt the living in order to bring peace to the dead. In the shadows: Take part in a dark and criminal world that will appeal to your most basic instincts at every step, just like in your favorite noir movies. Push your moral limits to the rhythm of jazz and find out how far you are willing to go to complete your mission. Vice and virtue: Bet hard, drink till collapse, surrender to pleasure, become friends with the scum, bribe the good guys… Imagination is the limit, but be careful if you don't want to end with a bullet in your head. Dressed to kill: Distribute your experience points into four different parameters (Luck, Intelligence, Force and Endurance) and choose your equipment according to your custom build. Plus, you’ll be able to customize your character’s appearance — classy guys have bigger chances to win! Silver and lead: Besides taking part in an intense and dashing narrative, you also get to fight against big, bad, bosses. Keep an eye on their moves or you’ll soon be sleeping with the fishes. Pecaminosa includes the DLC La Soirée , an epilogue that offers new answers on the disappearance of detective Sullivan. There's something threatening in the air, and it's not syphilis. The Pecaminosa elite are up to their necks in a series of highly shady dealings, and Sully seems to have found out about it before he disappeared. As his former partner, John Souza will take it upon himself to track Sully down to find answers and, in the process, teach these filthy rich guys a lesson they will never forget. Here you’ll find: An original piece of story where your choices dictate John’s and Sully’s end. Find new clues, tie up the loose ends and close a surprising and supernatural story that will prove to you just how weak the flesh is… New enemies to face, including an unknown and fearsome boss. He looks pretty confident, so don’t rest on your laurels! More locations to investigate and characters that will give you valuable information (or do their best to stop you). New Poker and Slot machines minigames at casinos. Don't let anyone control how to waste your paycheck! Tons of jokes, each worse than the last — we keep trying…",

AccrO is an acrobatic simulator, not an arcade-style game. There is no scoring system or step-by-step progression. Controlling a full acrobatic quadcopter will be as hard as in real life. To run the simulator, you will need a 4 Axis controller (USB remote controller, XBOX360 gamepad, or a 4-axis joystick) and at least a mid-level graphics card, please check the system requirements. From the drone community for the drone community, AccrO allows new pilots to improve muscular memory and try different setups. Hardboiled veterans can tweak flight controller rates and thrust-to-weight ratio matching their favorite quad, aiming to create new acrobatic tricks in a simulated environment. Welcome to AccrO!",

Still, in the underground, the beat goes on. Earth's greatest musicologist, Dr. Dysco, has made a discovery... Although they have proven themselves immune to all conventional weapons, music can be used to destroy the robots. Dysco begins constructing a musical arsenal to wipe out the robot invaders. On the verge of completing the ultimate weapon, the Rainbow Laser, Dysco vanishes. Can you find the Rainbow Laser ? Can you save Dysco ? Can you survive in the Dungeon ? Rainbow Laser Disco Dungeon is part twin stick-shooter, part rhythm game, part dungeon crawler. Every action, every laser blast and robot explosion, happens according to the rhythm of the music. Each weapon you pick up automatically fires to its own rhythm and is synchronized to the game's music. As you dual wield your way through the dungeon you'll be mixing a unique musical experience. Each 101 room dungeon is randomly generated from an ever-expanding pool of hand-crafted challenging rooms. Rainbow Laser Disco Dungeon has all of the features you need! Easy Mode for players who only want a moderate challenge Reduced Flashing and Image Fine Tuning for photosensitive players Extra-Easy Mode for players who don't want to be challenged One-handed gamepad mode It's also got some slick features that you don't really need...

It will help you in enhancing your experience with many useful features, including: 💪 Body tracking 👋 Head hand tracking 🎮 Controller emulation 📺 tVR (virtual reality on monitor or TV) 🔧 Utilities WHAT MAKES DRIVER4VR STAND OUT? 🎮 Simple powerful VR features 🥇 Years of experience ongoing development 🤖 Lots of usage options (body tracking, controller emulation more) 🌎 Global Discord community ⚙️ Easy setup helpful tutorials 💰 Affordable price for a convenient VR tool Driver4VR is also the main source of funding for WalkinVR, the first software that allows people with disabilities to play VR games. MANY WAYS OF BODY TRACKING This VR solution allows adding body tracking for existing VR setups like Oculus, HTC Vive or Valve Index. It can emulate body tracking with: Puppeteer - actually emulation with hand controllers :) Kinect Web Camera Oculus CV1 Touch Controllers Nolo VR PS Controllers with PS Eye cameras via PSMoveServiceEx Camera Markers with PS Eye Camera VR ON MONITOR OR TV Driver4VR allows users to play some VR games on TV (this solution is called tVR). It’s an alternative way to use VR content for people who for some reason can't do it in a classic way (with headset and controllers). 3DOF and 6DOF TRACKING POSSIBILITIES For 3DoF Headsets like phone-vr, PSVR or VRTek, Driver4VR can add position tracking and controller emulation. It also uses alternative devices (previous generation consoles, mice, keyboard) to emulate virtual reality controllers and input. Additionally, it can add positional tracking (6DoF) in case you have a headset that just supports the rotation like phone-based VR, VR Tek, Pimax, etc. It uses Kinect to emulate positional tracking. Please note that we are using alternative tracking methods to approximate a true 6DOF experience. You may want to look into Oculus Quest or similar devices at a cheap price for the head and hands tracking and use Driver4VR for only the body tracking - feet and waist. SMART CONTROLLER EMULATION Controllers can be emulated with devices like PS Move, Joy-Con, Wii Remote, VR Gamepad, Mouse, Xbox Controller, Keyboard. Combined with positional tracking, it makes a complete virtual reality setup with hand tracking and input. Without Kinect you can use those devices alone to emulate position a'la Oculus Go which is called Virtual Tracking. USEFUL VR UTILITIES Driver4VR is also a set of useful virtual reality utilities like e.g. Virtual Move, Input Emulation, fix floor position, emulation of broken Index thumbstick with touchpad and many others. REQUIREMENTS Bluetooth devices (Bluetooth connection required): Nintendo Switch JoyCon Nintendo Wii Remote PS3 Move / PS4 Move VR Gamepad Web Camera: Any PC Compatible Web Camera Kinect: Kinect 360 - Kinect 360 adapter and standard USB 2.0 Kinect 2.0 - Kinect 2.0 adapter and USB 3.0 IMPORTANT UPDATES SUPPORT PSVR Display Driver and PS4 Camera tracking goes out of support by end of June 2024. Wii Remote model RVL-CNT-01-TR is not yet supported at the moment but working on it. When using the Driver4VR for the first time, it MUST be started from the Launch button, to ensure any additional services and drivers it requires get installed. Got questions or installation issues?

        "Detailed Description": "Welcome to the front Soldier! Trench Simulator is a 50 vs 50 Online World War 1 Third Person Shooter simulator. Packed with authentic weaponry, vehicles , beautifully designed trenches and stationary weapons, Trench Simulator aims to recreate the epic charges across No Man's Land in World War 1 in a large multiplayer setting on small-medium sized maps. No more running and gunning! No hiding in buildings ! Just open field, shell holes, artillery barrages, machine gun fire. Just like the Great War! You will find yourself charging out of your trench with 50 comrades and hope to not get mowed down by the defending team's Vicker's or Lewis guns or blown to bits by player controlled artillery cannons. You know those old black and white snippets of footage you see from World War 1 where you see troops running out of a trench and storming No Man's Land? Well this is what we are trying to recreate! Each map will feature a historic battle with real authentic uniforms and weapons. No Man's Land will be a prominent part of each map and to ensure players get immersed in the battle we are introducing a game mode where attacking teams will be FORCED out of the trench to charge the enemy. Upon the start of the game, after the classic WW1 whistle, an invisible force will be lifting players out of the trench and will not allow anyone to return. The attacking team is to advanced across No Man's Land while the defending team stands their ground in their trench to try and handle the oncoming wave. Defenders will have two machine guns strategically positioned in their trench to help. 4 defending players will be positioned at the rear of the front to man the artillery guns. Attackers will be able to use a tank to provide support and will be equipped with multiple grenades. The defending team will have a chance to counter-attack and be forced out of the trench if they are able to clear out the oncoming wave. The winner will be the one who gains the most ground! This style of game play is just one of several game modes to come. We realize it is harder for attackers to win, since they are probably getting mowed down and blown up , so we've equipped them with extra grenades and have made adequate cover across No Man's Land. This will make for epic battles and a experience you've never had before in a shooter game! . We also plan to introduce authentic airplanes in future maps. One more awesome feature that Trench Simulator will have is a medals system! Play for some time and you will earn a service medal or complete certain tasks or get a certain amount of kills and earn medals too. The best part about these rewards? You can actually wear them on your in game character during live battles! Need to know who trust and follow on the battlefield? Look for the soldier with several badges and medals on his uniform. Have two enemies in your scope sight but not sure which one to take out? Get the one with the more medals pinned on his uniform. This will be an optional feature. Trench Simulator will bring you an experience you've never had in a shooting game. It's historically accurate, chaotic and fun. Wishlist us today!",

Choose from a roman warrior far ahead of his time, a tomboy spanish swordswoman who wishes to escape her constraining society, a boisterous samurai who will be put to the ultimate test, and many more fascinating characters. The game is a 3rd person fighter where you face your opponent face-to-face. You will engage in fantastic one-on-one battles that reward fast-paced reflexes to slice, block, chop, parry, and stab the opposition. With an easy control scheme comprising of two buttons and 4 directions, you'll be battling like a true warrior in no time. the four-way directions are used for defense while your buttons provide the offense. For those who are willing to learn the game's intricacies, stats and frame data are available to inspect for each character. In addition, 4 playstyles known as Disciplines can be selected that will alter your character's stats for fine-tuning the way you play. Give your character more power, make them faster, or increase their defense. The right discipline is there for your needs. Take the battles online or keep them local with friends. Train in the practice mode to improve your skills or take a break with various mini-games. Customize your character's colors in the color editor and create your own AI-controlled opponent to unleash your creation for others players. About Toolkitz and Child Arms I have been creating games as a hobby since 2001 and created Toolkitz in 2012. Many projects have come and gone over the years but Child Arms is the most ambitious project yet. With the concept conceived in 2004, formed in 2014, and finally beginning production in 2019, this game aims to put everything that I have learned from the past 2 decades. But the ambition for this game goes beyond just this title alone. The scope of this game alone is so large that I had to split it into 3 parts, with this game being the first. With a studio doing art and a composer on board, we are a small team trying to make an amazing game, but we can't do it without the support of a community. That is why I am working hard to make Child Arms the best game it can be and become more than just an indie game, but something far greater. Your support is highly appreciated in this early stage of development.",

Your support is highly appreciated in this early stage of development.",

Assemble your arsenal of increasingly excessive weapons, track spiders across suburbia, and burn everything in your path! HEATWAVE is a new free chapter with more weapons and new spiders! To defeat spiders you must exploit their one weakness: FIRE. Or bullets. Or explosions, throwing stars, gettin’ smushed by stuff...pretty much anything, really. But that doesn’t mean it’ll be easy - first you’ve gotta find the spiders. Use state-of-the-art arachnid tracking technology to pinpoint your quarry’s location among hundreds of potential hiding spots - then, torch everything and smash the spider with a frying pan after it runs out. It’s the only way to be sure. Features Dozens of weapons. Creepy crawlies. “Realistic” fire simulation system. Gratuitous chaos and destruction. Finally learn the truth about spiders.",

        "Detailed Description": "The Grand Lord is a branching dialogue driven adventure created by two first-time developers in Unreal Engine. STORY The game's starting incident is two-fold; your father is retiring as the Grand Lord of the land and your semi-evil brother is coming to take the throne. You have to visit the three factions of your kingdom: the peasants, swamp people, and aristocrats. You can either convince them to join your rule, or, if you do not like them, decide to not have relations with them. At the core of the game is diplomacy and the question what would you do if you were thrust into a leadership position? That question is significant since the player has a large amount of agency in determining the direction of the story. For example, you could decide that you do not like how any of the factions operate and tell them that you don't want anything to do with them! All of this culminates in a final strategy battle at the end of the game. Here your faction loyalties are put to the test as you control your forces and battle back the enemy army. There are several variations of this battle depending on your loyalties, so it allows for high replayability as you can experiment with different combinations of faction loyalty. GAMEPLAY This is a dialogue driven adventure, and the majority of the player's time is spent interacting with the story. This is done through many different branching dialogue trees and choices presented to the player. Selecting these choices affects several hidden variables such as fear, honor, gold, and faction respect. The value of these plays an import role in dialogues and on the outcome of the story There are many opportunities to choose different branching paths to go down. Every choice made has an impact, either directly or indirectly, on the story. In addition to the main branching story system, there are some fun adventure mechanics in the travel levels, and there is a large strategy component in the end as you defend the capital from your brother's siege. The strategy is done through dialogue where you choose how to position your army for the coming attack. A single play through can range from 1-3 hours depending on how fast you read and go through the story. For most people, it will likely be in the 2 hour range. In addition, there are at least 4 unique endings with many different variations of each so a player will likely find themselves playing through at least 3-4 times, if not more! That being said, a single play through is best experienced in one sitting. Enjoy your journey through a heightened world full of ridiculous characters and absurd moments in this light-hearted, medieval, adventure.",
        "Short Description": "Thrust into power unwillingly, how would you rule? Travel through your kingdom full of idiots, hot heads, and crazies, and unite them all. Or, tell them all to go to hell. The choice is yours. Rule your way as you try to become the Grand Lord.",

In this dark and otherworldly period of Russian history, the current financial crisis and rising crime rates appear bleak in comparison.

Assuming the role of the collective farm’s headmaster, you must filter visitors before let them inside the UFO.

        "Detailed Description": "City of Thugs is a turn-based roguelite RPG, set in the modern world, where you'll have to fight your way through a city full of randomly generated thugs. Gameplay: At the beginning of each game you'll be able to create your own character, with a highly customizable look, attributes, active and passive skills, weapons and more. It all depends on you that you're gonna go all-in for high damage, or you'll follow a more balanced approach. You can try different tactics to find out which playstyle fits you the most. After you'll die you'll lose your stuff and your progress you've made in the city, but you can keep your earned XP. After leveling up you'll receive more money to spend on weapons and more points to spend on attributes. There are several active and passive skills and all of them have their unique advantages. Be sure to try all of them to find out which of them are the most useful for your style. The game uses a first person perspective, so your enemies will stand in front of you. You'll not only see their health bar, but their wounds too, which will be different depending on whether it was caused by your knife or your gun. Also, injuries do matter: for example, you can do higher damage by aiming at their body, but severely injuring their shooting arm will cause a massive drop in their aiming skill. After a successful fight, loot your defeated enemies for money, food or bulletproof vests.. Or buy these at the specialized vendors, if you'll manage to come across with them in the city. Find and kill the boss to complete the game.. and before you'll start another round!! Key Features (version 0.1): -Highly customizable player character and randomly generated unique enemies -Nearly 150 clothing items (pants,skirts,T-shirts,jackets,shoes and more!) -Nearly 200 facial items (hairstyles,beards,eyes,noses,etc.) -19 weapons, including melee weapons (like hatchet or machete), and ranged weapons (from simple pistols to machine guns and shotguns) -Turn-based combat system -Visible injury system, which affects gameplay too -12 attributes to spend points on -9 active skills and 6 passive skills to choose from -3 locations (pub, city streets, office) -3 different vendors (arms dealer, doctor, food vendor) -Randomly selected map (maps are currently pre-made, later it will change) -Beautiful hand-drawn graphics -Hours of fun and a high replay value (due to the roguelike elements you'll never play the same level again)",

It all depends on you that you're gonna go all-in for high damage, or you'll follow a more balanced approach. You can try different tactics to find out which playstyle fits you the most. After you'll die you'll lose your stuff and your progress you've made in the city, but you can keep your earned XP. After leveling up you'll receive more money to spend on weapons and more points to spend on attributes. There are several active and passive skills and all of them have their unique advantages. Be sure to try all of them to find out which of them are the most useful for your style. The game uses a first person perspective, so your enemies will stand in front of you. You'll not only see their health bar, but their wounds too, which will be different depending on whether it was caused by your knife or your gun. Also, injuries do matter: for example, you can do higher damage by aiming at their body, but severely injuring their shooting arm will cause a massive drop in their aiming skill. After a successful fight, loot your defeated enemies for money, food or bulletproof vests.. Or buy these at the specialized vendors, if you'll manage to come across with them in the city. Find and kill the boss to complete the game.. and before you'll start another round!! Key Features (version 0.1): -Highly customizable player character and randomly generated unique enemies -Nearly 150 clothing items (pants,skirts,T-shirts,jackets,shoes and more!) -Nearly 200 facial items (hairstyles,beards,eyes,noses,etc.) -19 weapons, including melee weapons (like hatchet or machete), and ranged weapons (from simple pistols to machine guns and shotguns) -Turn-based combat system -Visible injury system, which affects gameplay too -12 attributes to spend points on -9 active skills and 6 passive skills to choose from -3 locations (pub, city streets, office) -3 different vendors (arms dealer, doctor, food vendor) -Randomly selected map (maps are currently pre-made, later it will change) -Beautiful hand-drawn graphics -Hours of fun and a high replay value (due to the roguelike elements you'll never play the same level again)",

Also there is a dungeon map-generator, but it's unfinished and not integrated. Graphics will be changed and balance will be updated. Plenty of dialogs, events, tasks, items and objects are gonna be added. Have in plans to add co-op up to 4 players and map-creation tools.

        "Detailed Description": "Discord About the Game In Bromeliad you are stranded on a pacific island where you are a Human-Bear. You transformed into a Human-Bear because of a mysterious, unknown creature that gave you its strange venom. After that, a giant bear jumped on you and you became a mutant. You don`t know what has happened, or where you are, or where your hunter team is. You have to survive, gathering materials to build tools, bases/houses/castles. You will need to hunt for food, explore, tame animals and creatures and much more... but the only strange thing other than you being a mutant is that, at night, strange creatures crawl and sneak over the island trying to find you. Features: Survive and explore this living island. Chop down trees and break rocks to craft tools, build bases... Tame animals and creatures and keep them as pet, to protect you from enemies. At night creatures will attack, so be ready. And much more... Your destiny is to survive and find an ancient element hidden on the island so that you can go back to being normal as a human. Then you will be able to remember everything and return home, but remember, its not so easy to get there because you are not alone.",

        "Detailed Description": "The Emperor’s Own is a story-driven adventure game with RPG elements. It features deep, multi-dimensional characters, difficult moral dilemmas, and a mature, branching narrative where your decisions truly matter. NOTE: THE BELOW DESCRIBES WHAT’S PLANNED IN THE FULL VERSION OF THE GAME. NOT ALL OF IT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN THE FREE ALPHA TEASER. The story takes place in an alternate universe, inspired by the Russian Empire at the dawn of the 19th century. You play as a young officer in Imperial Secret Intelligence. The empire is exhausted by foreign wars and mounting internal protest. The division between the haves and the have-nots has never been as stark. A peasant uprising is threatening to turn into a bloody class-based civil war. How far will you go to do your sworn duty? Will you restore order by any means necessary? Or will you instead throw kindling into the fire, and watch it burn all around you? In The Emperor’s Own, the choice is always yours. The world awaiting you is one of contrasts and extremes, from the dizzying wealth of the imperial palace and the capital, to the poverty and destitution of backwater villages. You’ll be fully immersed in a time and place unlike quite any before seen in a computer game. We don’t sugarcoat anything, and don’t pull any punches. You’ll experience that world and its atmosphere with all the glory and all the horror it has to offer, without any fairy-tales, magic, or monsters. Only real people attempting to find their way through trying times, showcasing the best and the worst that human beings are capable of. You'll take on the role of Cornet Alexander Obolenskii, a young officer recently recruited into Secret Intelligence because of outstanding accomplishments in the Imperial Academy, and an even more outstanding last name. The unit answers to no one but the Emperor himself. You’re entrusted with life and death authority over all other residents of the Empire, from the lowest peasant to the highest aristocrat. Will you use that power to carry out your orders? To advance your personal interests? To fight for an idealistic cause? That is, of course, up to you. Along your adventure you’ll meet a memorable cast of characters. Each has his own thoughts, motivations, and hidden agendas. The world is not black and white, and there are no heroes or villains. You’ll encounter daring officers, noble ladies, corrupt officials, firebrand rebels, sadistic psychopaths, and God knows whoever else. The game is fully voiced, and all the characters are brought to life by top-tier professional voice actors. In addition to grand political intrigue, there are personal moments to experience, including friendship, family, and romance. And should you wish to indulge your baser desires, there will be an opportunity to do that as well. The story is not linear, and your decisions truly matter. They have far-reaching consequences that don’t reveal themselves until later on. Once you make a choice, you’ll have to live with it, no matter the outcome. There are no right and wrong answers, and no one is ever safe. Any character, no matter how important, can die at any moment, perhaps even by your hand. The year is 1803. The Slavomir Empire is recovering after a vicious conflict with its southern neighbor. Word is spreading that the uneasy peace is about to give way to another war, even more bloody and devastating than the last. Emperor Alexei III has raised taxes and increased the term of military service, further inflaming the already exhausted peasantry. Dissatisfaction in the provinces is increasing daily, and serfs are at the limits of their patience. Few people are aware of the true situation in the Empire, however. Most of high society are still attending balls and receptions in the capital without a care in the world, although there’s discontent among some of the nobility as well. Secret societies and plots of all manner abound. The line between enemy and friend, truth and lies is getting ever more blurred. The Empire is atop a powder keg; all that’s missing is a spark. And in the midst of it all, rumors of mysterious and supernatural events in the borderlands have reached the capital. Peasants are whispering that the Emperor has lost God’s favor, and that a change is needed at the very top…",

In turn with the enemy, you make moves with your cards or use objects. To win the game, you need to destroy the main card (Place of Power) of the enemy. There are no pre-prepared decks here - all cards and items are selected in turn from the general list. Already at the stage of choosing and placing cards, you can get a significant advantage over the enemy by blocking or taking the cards he needs. All cards in the game (Heroes and Places of Power) have basic characteristics (attack, defense, health) and 2-3 unique skills. Items play a supporting role. They can both enhance the basic parameters of your cards, and inflict direct damage to enemy cards. For a comfortable game, it is better to start playing with a friend, gradually learning the abilities of different cards and items, their strengths and weaknesses. At the moment, the game has 48 Hero cards, 13 Places of Power cards and more than 80 items and rings.",

        "Detailed Description": "On the morning of the 6th June 1944 the Western Allies began the largest seaborne invasion in the history of warfare. D-Day would mark the start of a vicious campaign to wrestle North West Europe from German control. The following months would see the ancient fields, farms and villages serve as a battleground for new, lethal weapons that would become legendary. The Troop follows the campaign of British and Canadian forces as they face the German Heer and SS in Normandy. Take command of infantry, motorised and armoured units in desperate tactical turn-based combat against an AI opponent that is challenging and unpredictable, but fair and fallible. Play as British/Canadian or German forces across over 30 maps and 4 play modes. Simple, complete control - The Troop embraces the best traditions of classic tabletop war gaming combined with the interactivity and excitement the digital format affords. You have complete control over your units' actions; tanks will not expose their weak side armour with unexpected pathing, hidden guns will not reveal their positions by firing prematurely, infantry will not flee inexplicably when victory is a few heroic paces away. You are free to take your time... but any mistakes are yours and yours alone. Your AI opponent has no special knowledge and is subject to all the same rules and restrictions as you. The enemy has no fixed plan and will vary deployment and tactics with each replay. Story mode Follow the narrative of the campaign from D-Day, playing as a range of different units (Commonwealth and German) in different situations as history plays out across Normandy. Skirmish mode Choose your scenario, choose your side, choose your force, set your enemy restrictions... Play. What will the enemy bring to the fight and what tactics will they use? You'll have to wait and see, but it will not be the same as last time! Endless replayability. Campaign Take command of a persistent force across a series of linked, historically-inspired scenarios. Losses are permanent but units that survive multiple deployments gain experience and effectiveness. 4 campaigns are available: 8th Armoured Brigade, 21st Panzer Division, 31st Tank Brigade, SS Panzer Division. Battlegroup A dynamic, 5-9 mission operation played with a randomised, persistent player force. Choose your difficulty, play as you want - The Troop does not have one difficulty setting. Instead players can control a variety of features, rules and information settings to tailor their gameplay experience for the most enjoyable challenge. A game, not a simulation - The Troop is born from a life long passion for WW2 history and turn-based games. Our aim is to give a little glimpse of that history through an enjoyable challenge. The events depicted are set in the broad reality of the historical campaigns, the missions themselves however are fictional and geared towards an enjoyable challenge rather than a strict depiction of history. We hope only to do justice to the spirit of those countless memoirs and after action reports that survive and continue to fascinate us.",

        "Detailed Description": "Play with friends co-operatively or form hostile factions In this open-world galactic sandbox, how you play is up to you! Bring your friends into the frontier in your own private server, or make new friends (and enemies) in large public multiplayer servers. Play peacefully in co-op, or use the dynamic multiplayer faction system to band together and split apart dynamically as allegiances change. Build ships from scratch and travel to new planets Your first planet is where you’ll learn to survive, but that’s just the start. Build your very own starship and use it to colonise new worlds. It won’t be easy, and only the most successful colonies will be able to pool the resources and knowledge necessary to break orbit. Once you launch, the stars hold brand-new planets, new biomes, bosses and challenges. Craft, research, loot and exploit your environment You’ll need to prepare to take on this hostile part of the galaxy. Get mining, farming, growing, developing, researching, and building hundreds of different items, from winter combat gear to advanced laboratories. Find something you can’t work out for yourself. Strap on your handcrafted laser rifle and venture out into the unknown to explore dungeons, procedural bases, NPC stores and much more. Defend what you’ve built, or take on the galaxy Defend your colony with fast-paced combat that utilizes physics like bullet drop, projectile speed and spread. Thwart enemy raids on your base with your stock of handcrafted grenades. Tired of just defending? Lay waste to enemy bases with destructible terrain as you wield everything from rusty old carbines to nuke launchers and energy weapons that harness the power of lightning! Develop and construct advanced bases for protection Grow from a tiny outpost into an advanced, nuclear-powered fortress. Manage resources carefully and choose research paths based on the items and challenges you encounter on each planet. Watch out, though: the bigger your colony gets, the more of a target it becomes for raiders (and jealous friends). Automate work and train up a team Even out here, you’re not alone. Save AI survivors and build a colony together. A range of unique stats, perks and flaws mean every colonist has something different to contribute. As your AI colonists complete tasks they’ll level up and get smarter, stronger and faster. Best of all, you can assign tasks and orders to NPCs to do the grunt work for you and prioritize their roles based on those skills. Want to take a break from mining to destroy an underground alien nest? Let your colonists handle that for you! And Remember Your ship may be in ruins, your ammunition running low, and your teammates scattered across the surface, but remember this: You’re more than just another adventurous spirit. You’re a Farworld Pioneer.",

Trapped in this purgatory, use your martial arts mastery and weapon expertise to wipe the slate clean for yourself and people of Secret Garden by dismantling each of the unique syndicates one at a time, in whatever order you wish. BRUTAL FLUID COMBAT SYSTEMS Tenjutsu blends roguelike mechanics with intensely fast melee combat and demanding tactical precision.

CHOOSE YOUR PATH TO CONQUEST Carefully select the order you attack each of the four syndicates with each run, deciding which one to take by surprise with relative ease and which will have time to reinforce their ranks before you reach their doorstep. Gauge your preferred playstyle against each syndicates strengths to decide the optimal path through the opposition knowing your opponents grow stronger the longer you let their forces swell.

        "Detailed Description": "Add to wishlist About the Game Take on the role of a war veteran forced into becoming an executioner. Once you've served long enough, you'll be set free and allowed to leave town. But no one told you when that will happen… You never thought of pursuing torture as a valid career choice, but as they say: work is work. Besides, you know that in addition to forcing confessions, you'll sometimes get more interesting contracts like staking the skull of a dead man accused of vampirism. And that's definitely some variety. Find out what it's like to be an executioner who is open to bribes. Enemies of the hanged man will try to bribe you to use a short rope and prolong the victim's suffocation. Or maybe the family of a woman condemned to death by crushing will want to ease her suffering for an appropriate fee. Will you accept or will you refuse? Be indifferent to screams, pleas, begging and assurances of innocence. This isn't kindergarten - it's an old forge fashioned into a torture chamber. And here, you are the master. You rule and divide… mostly through dismemberment. Carry out punishment, behead commoners and nobility alike. But remember! Each execution must be carried out to the letter, otherwise you face an angry crowd and dissatisfied authorities who may be out for your blood. Main features Enforce punishment, flog the unruly mob, hang the guilty, put people in stocks and swing your axe without mercy Face authorities who are dissatisfied with your work Fix the scaffold, remove carrion from the city, help with examining corpses, and even tear out teeth! Supervise the work of the municipal brothel and collect taxes Develop your character in the direction you choose Be on your guard! Some contracts will be motivated by political and social reasons! Find out what it feels like to be a war veteran forced to become an executioner",

And that's definitely some variety. Find out what it's like to be an executioner who is open to bribes. Enemies of the hanged man will try to bribe you to use a short rope and prolong the victim's suffocation. Or maybe the family of a woman condemned to death by crushing will want to ease her suffering for an appropriate fee. Will you accept or will you refuse? Be indifferent to screams, pleas, begging and assurances of innocence. This isn't kindergarten - it's an old forge fashioned into a torture chamber. And here, you are the master. You rule and divide… mostly through dismemberment. Carry out punishment, behead commoners and nobility alike. But remember! Each execution must be carried out to the letter, otherwise you face an angry crowd and dissatisfied authorities who may be out for your blood. Main features Enforce punishment, flog the unruly mob, hang the guilty, put people in stocks and swing your axe without mercy Face authorities who are dissatisfied with your work Fix the scaffold, remove carrion from the city, help with examining corpses, and even tear out teeth! Supervise the work of the municipal brothel and collect taxes Develop your character in the direction you choose Be on your guard! Some contracts will be motivated by political and social reasons! Find out what it feels like to be a war veteran forced to become an executioner",

This game is all about relaxation, peace, enjoying the nature, its sounds and realistic environment. The game uses the latest Unreal Engine 4, which makes graphics and lightning look super realistic. The main gameplay is based on a simple task – to collect the necessary amount of firewood before the nightfall, while keeping the fire from going out. All these conditions are pushing you to manage the time correctly. Each time the firewood will be located in different places, that brings some variety to every attempt.",

Each collectible card also includes a sort of adult-oriented mini-scene featuring that card's waifu, and these together account for another 25 000 words so far, with more cards already in development for planned free updates to the game.

Choose from individual factions each with their own unique units and upgrades, unlock technology, and build sprawling cities with buildings and fortifications. Micro 4x Empis is 4X distilled to its base processes and streamlined for quick matches so that you can get in and out as quickly as you'd like. Unlike large and lumbering 4X games that can go on for ages, Empis delivers fast paced and tactical gameplay to keep you engaged only for as long as you'd like it to. Chess-like combat turns. Empis avoids problems often plaguing multiplayer turn-based games. Players go back and forth with combat while simultaneously building their cities. Unique Factions Choose between multiple factions - each with their own unique units and strategies. Play as the clever Falmorius, Steadfast Tyrus Imperium, or the ever Wild Keepers of the Forest. New Worlds Every Time Empis procedurally generates new worlds for matches every time you play, giving you fresh and interesting chokepoints and control areas every time. Grow and Outsmart Expand your cities into this new world. Create synergies among your units and out-think your opponent's strategy. Destroy them at all costs.",

        "Detailed Description": "Blast spirits out of a haunted subway system! Can your team defeat rival exterminators, shoddy gear, and City Hall? You've been a daemon dissipator for years, carrying a rainbow blaster and learning the ins and outs of magic to zap electromagnetic monsters into static. After following the jobs from one end of Septenland to the other, you've settled down here in Barrington: an old city. A weird city. A city boiling with spirits, specters, and daemons. It's the perfect place to start a company of your own. The Luminous Underground is a 660,000-word interactive secondary-world science fantasy novel by Phoebe Barton, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based—without graphics or sound effects—and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. Your team is just you and McCowan, your friend and business partner, but it's hard for two people to run an operation like this. When you applied for a contract with the Barrington Transit Commission, you didn't expect anything but a flat rejection. But you got it! And now you've got to find more teammates, sharpen your skills, and put a dent in the spirit population while staying well clear of the electrified rail. But you'll find that Barrington's underground is much more than its tunnels. There's a forest down here, teeming with crystalline trees that glitter under your flashlight. There's a portal to the Vitalscape, a super-luminous alternative realm of being. You can enter it through a mural, but you'll need a crystal tuning fork to get back. There are giants, robots, daemons, and even a giant robot daemon. Of course, corruption and mismanagement festers down here. Is this all part of your competitors’ attempts to secure the subway contract for their own? Is City Hall's stingy maintenance budget to blame? How much can you get paid not to fix this problem? Are you ready to patrol your patch of subway, or will you stand by and let it crumble? Play as male, female, or nonbinary; gay, straight, aromantic, or asexual. Descend into a magic-drenched subway and face down spirits beneath the streets! Help time travelers integrate into the incredible world of today. Dig up megacorporate corruption while you dust off vacuum tubes. Investigate mysterious disappearances down in the underground. Cooperate with other outfits in town, or act on your own Lead the mayor to safety through a gauntlet of terrors! Save the lives of a missing crew under an impossible sky. Calm down a giant woman who's got you in the palm of her hand. Strange things are crawling out of the subway. Someone better call you.",

        "Detailed Description": "this game is hard and not for everyone you gonna tryhard to finish level! you gonna suffer! Alexander Parker, a brilliant scientist, found himself trapped in an experimental quantum reality simulator. The cutting-edge technology was designed to challenge the mind, pushing the boundaries of human cognition. However, something went terribly wrong during the test, and Alexander became entangled within the virtual labyrinth with no apparent way out. Inside the simulation, Alexander discovered that he had to navigate through a series of increasingly complex levels. Each level presented unique challenges and puzzles that tested his intelligence, creativity, and problem-solving skills. The catch was that failure to solve a level or making the wrong move could result in a simulated death, resetting him back to the beginning. As Alexander delved deeper into the quantum labyrinth, he encountered surreal landscapes, mind-bending puzzles, and even faced virtual adversaries. He realized that escaping this digital maze required not just scientific knowledge but also a strategic and adaptable mindset. The simulation mirrored his memories and experiences, creating a surreal blend of reality and fiction. Alexander encountered manifestations of his own fears and doubts, forcing him to confront and overcome personal obstacles as he progressed through the levels. He spent countless simulated hours deciphering cryptic codes, navigating optical illusions, and outsmarting virtual enemies. The lines between the real and virtual worlds blurred, challenging Alexander's sanity and resolve. Yet, fueled by determination and a desire to return to the real world, he pressed on. Throughout his journey, Alexander discovered hidden messages left by the simulation's creators, guiding him and providing clues about the nature of his predicament. He began to suspect that the experiment was not just a test of intellect but a deeper exploration of the human psyche. As he approached the final level, the challenges became more abstract and metaphysical. Alexander faced a mirror version of himself, a manifestation of his own consciousness.

        "About the Game": "this game is hard and not for everyone you gonna tryhard to finish level! you gonna suffer! Alexander Parker, a brilliant scientist, found himself trapped in an experimental quantum reality simulator. The cutting-edge technology was designed to challenge the mind, pushing the boundaries of human cognition. However, something went terribly wrong during the test, and Alexander became entangled within the virtual labyrinth with no apparent way out. Inside the simulation, Alexander discovered that he had to navigate through a series of increasingly complex levels. Each level presented unique challenges and puzzles that tested his intelligence, creativity, and problem-solving skills. The catch was that failure to solve a level or making the wrong move could result in a simulated death, resetting him back to the beginning. As Alexander delved deeper into the quantum labyrinth, he encountered surreal landscapes, mind-bending puzzles, and even faced virtual adversaries. He realized that escaping this digital maze required not just scientific knowledge but also a strategic and adaptable mindset. The simulation mirrored his memories and experiences, creating a surreal blend of reality and fiction. Alexander encountered manifestations of his own fears and doubts, forcing him to confront and overcome personal obstacles as he progressed through the levels. He spent countless simulated hours deciphering cryptic codes, navigating optical illusions, and outsmarting virtual enemies. The lines between the real and virtual worlds blurred, challenging Alexander's sanity and resolve. Yet, fueled by determination and a desire to return to the real world, he pressed on. Throughout his journey, Alexander discovered hidden messages left by the simulation's creators, guiding him and providing clues about the nature of his predicament. He began to suspect that the experiment was not just a test of intellect but a deeper exploration of the human psyche. As he approached the final level, the challenges became more abstract and metaphysical. Alexander faced a mirror version of himself, a manifestation of his own consciousness. To escape, he had to confront his inner demons, accept his flaws, and integrate his experiences into a coherent understanding of self. With a final burst of insight, Alexander cracked the code of the quantum labyrinth. The simulation glitched, and reality warped around him. Suddenly, he found himself back in the laboratory, breathing heavily, with the virtual maze dissipating like a digital illusion. The experiment, though perilous, had changed Alexander. He emerged with a profound appreciation for the fragility of the human mind and the importance of self-discovery.

However, with William making an unwanted return from the Happy Glowstick Funtime Re-education Camp , everything starts becoming more complicated for Grendel as she has to contend with final school exams, her parents divorcing, and an unwanted new stepsister. The protagonist is naturally dragged into these affairs as he/she has to contend with an assassination attempt by Grendel's father, being abducted by Grendel's mother, an increasingly hostile (to The Council Of The Unseen ) secretary and a debauched boss, culminating in the protagonist being forced to destroy The Council Of The Unseen , by using their own weapons against them. Spanning five years from the end of No Regrets to the start of The Spy Of America And The Long Vacation , this episode concludes the main prequel arc - with a bang 11 bad endings and one true ending Multiple routes 100,000+ word story, with an estimated play time of 6 - 8 hours.

        "Detailed Description": "The year is 4335. You are one of few remaining United States evacuees from the Great Solar Evacuation. You wear the flag of a country that was shelled out of existence nearly two kiloyears ago on Earth. The then CCCP won the space race. With the ability to control nearly all of space, it allowed them to influence economies and start conflicts. In a ten year period after the first landing on Mars, the CCCP declared war on its parent country, and then the world. Sides were taken, and bombs were dropped from outer space. CCCP and it’s allies were able to obliterate the majority of the opposition. This alliance of tyrannical world-enders was renamed the Federation a few hundred years later. Only after the first interstellar colonies were sent to a nearby solar system was the invention of sub-light speed travel. The Federation rules most of space in the current year. However, during the Great Evacuation of 2110 remaining freedom forces were able to commandeer a CCCP ship and plunge into outer space. You’ve inherited the responsibility of your ancestors to preserve the history of the United States. In the current year, the freedom fighters have but only a small planet with the technological advancement comparable to pre-war. Up against the universe controlling giant, the US Freedom Fighters are unable to mount any offensives. The USFF has taken great care, and nearly insurmountable risk to put you in your current position. You are born American and belong to the USFF, but you are a member of the Federation. You will stance yourself so that, upon your activation, you can return to Lazarus with the intelligence and tools needed to bring the Federation to its knees. God bless you, God bless the USFF, and God bless America. Interstellar space travel Fly your chosen ship throughout an entire solar system without loading screens. From the blackness of outer space to boots-on-the-ground, the entire universe is simulated without scene transitions! Land on terrestrial planets, fly the rings of massive gas giants and see the aurora over planets never yet discovered by man - all in your quest to cripple the Federation. Travel from system to system through gargantuan holes, and experience the gravity of a billion suns. See the specs of light fly by your windscreen and know they represent an American future yet to hold and a past never to forget. Station Based Economy Buy and sell resources, ships, and people at stations scattered across many solar systems. Use your knowledge of specific systems to fill a gap in the supply of certain items to advance yourself economically. Commit yourself to Federal missions, to gain standing at those stations for economic and political benefit. Deep Space Mining Use your ship’s mining equipment to crack ring asteroids like geodes. Pick the right rock and strike gold, pick the wrong one and spread dust. Collect the resources mined and sell them at a local station. Increase your standing at stations by interacting with them economically. Combat in Space Equip yourself to stand up against any foe. Train yourself to use your ship’s maneuverability to your advantage. Commit yourself to the elimination of space pirates, rebel against the system authorities, and grow your wealth and influence.",
