        "Detailed Description": "ADD FULL GAME TO YOUR WISHLIST About the Game We are developing this short experience into a new full game called Imagined Leviathans, which will greatly develop the gameplay and themes into a full 2-3 hours of play, with improved visuals and significantly more to do and see, including meeting other survivors “At fifty degrees below zero frostbite can strike in as few as five minutes” A poetic survival horror set in a future where climate change has rendered Britain an arctic wasteland. On your pilgrimage to Steel Henge you can only take what you can carry, so choose carefully what you leave behind. Immerse yourself in this starkly monochromatic world as you scavenge for fuel, take shelter in the shadows, and burn stories to stay warm. A malevolent presence lurks between the words, just out of reach. Alone, you must sacrifice everything you knew to deliver the bitter truth of this world to future generations. A brief but intense 20 minutes.",

Unbeliever urges you to face the challenge of pushing through and conquering your obstacles. As you progress you recall your memories and with them your powers. You will learn to manipulate the elements and exploit your enemies' weaknesses. Each fight requires a unique approach. This is more of an action rather than a platform game and an experiment on 2D combat mechanics. You can dodge, push your enemies back, burn them, or even send them back through time. The efficiency of your powers depend on your character development choices and on what path you choose to specialize on. Earn the right to challenge the Unbeliever by slaying beings of great power. You start with nothing and fight your way to the top. The story is explained through the form of memories that you unlock by making progress in the game. You gain spells and experience to upgrade your stats.Your ultimate goal: find the Unbeliever that killed the Old Gods and get your memory back. Recall your memories as you delve deeper into this cursed world. With every little bit of progress you make, you will remember something. The lore of the world will be explained through the memories you recall. Some of them give you information about locations or enemies and some give you new spells. How you develop your character is entirely up to you. There are 7 different stats that you can invest in. Health: The amount of pain you can standPower: The potential to cast spells and tumbleAttack: The damage you deal with your regular attacksTechnique: Defines your attack speed, jump distance and dodge distanceHatred: Offensive spells increase the damage they dealGuilt: Affects trick spell parametersDefiance: Affects the most powerful and rare spells.

Unbeliever urges you to face the challenge of pushing through and conquering your obstacles. As you progress you recall your memories and with them your powers. You will learn to manipulate the elements and exploit your enemies' weaknesses. Each fight requires a unique approach. This is more of an action rather than a platform game and an experiment on 2D combat mechanics. You can dodge, push your enemies back, burn them, or even send them back through time. The efficiency of your powers depend on your character development choices and on what path you choose to specialize on. Earn the right to challenge the Unbeliever by slaying beings of great power. You start with nothing and fight your way to the top. The story is explained through the form of memories that you unlock by making progress in the game. You gain spells and experience to upgrade your stats.Your ultimate goal: find the Unbeliever that killed the Old Gods and get your memory back. Recall your memories as you delve deeper into this cursed world. With every little bit of progress you make, you will remember something. The lore of the world will be explained through the memories you recall. Some of them give you information about locations or enemies and some give you new spells. How you develop your character is entirely up to you. There are 7 different stats that you can invest in. Health: The amount of pain you can standPower: The potential to cast spells and tumbleAttack: The damage you deal with your regular attacksTechnique: Defines your attack speed, jump distance and dodge distanceHatred: Offensive spells increase the damage they dealGuilt: Affects trick spell parametersDefiance: Affects the most powerful and rare spells.

        "Detailed Description": "Our chopper tailed-out after taking a hit... the pilot won’t be leaving the ground again. Now I have to lead my weary platoon back to our lines through the jungles and paddy fields. Entering what appears to be a friendly village - only to find it is a cover for a guerrilla faction - is just one of the things that helps our insomnia... that and the elusive psycho in my squad – I gotta figure out who he is before the morale factor becomes our worst enemy. Jeez, will this stupid war never end?! Back in the day when most games fell firmly into one camp such as shoot ‘em up, adventure, arcade action or map-based strategy, Lost Patrol was unusual in that it fused together elements of all these genres and more. With a combination of styles that tested a player’s entire gamut of skills, this 1990 release picked up fans on the popular platforms of the day – the Amiga, Atari ST and (for the relatively few PC gamers at the time) MS-DOS. Appearing in many ‘top 100’ lists, Lost Patrol is fondly remembered by those that played it, and is now available officially on Steam for the first time, courtesy of Pixel Games UK. The general action takes place on a military map, through which you are tasked with navigating a squad of men whose helicopter has crash-landed after an attack by the pesky guerrilla fighters. At certain points however the game field will switch view, requiring your arcade shooting skills, some hand-to-hand combat or other such surprises. Praised in its day for the quality of these additional graphic scenes, you’ll quickly realise why Lost Patrol is considered a retro classic!",
        "Short Description": "We’re fit, we’re alive, but we’re not back home In this classic multi-genre DOS game, take command of the seven survivors of a U.S. helicopter crash in Vietnam, desperately trekking across 57 miles of harsh terrain infested with booby traps and enemy soldiers.",

Praised in its day for the quality of these additional graphic scenes, you’ll quickly realise why Lost Patrol is considered a retro classic!",

When you run out of ammunition, you can replenish your supply by combining with your Carrier, and since the game is over even if your Carrier is hit by a certain number of bullets, it is important to keep your Carrier in a safe place. The original story was first published in 1984 in the PC magazine I/O (published by Kogaku-sha), and was so popular that it was ported to a number of consoles and later released as a commercial version. Many boys have dreamed at one time or another of being the pilot of a robot anime hero, such as Gundam. This game was so popular that it was later released in a much more powerful version, and ports were released for most of the major 8-bit PCs of the time. It is more than a one-on-one fighting game but less than a side-scrolling beat 'em up. The gameplay is unique in that there is a main character Attacker and a Carrier that the Attacker rides, and the two must work together to survive. The enemy can also deploy Attackers and Carriers that must be destroyed. The following three versions are included. * I/O version (port of the original) * Full version (port of the original) * The Ultimate Evolution version (a much-arranged version) In addition to the I/O version, there is also the Construction yesterday. Mods are also supported, so you can create the world you want and play with it.",
        "Short Description": "Hover Attack, the definitive version of the robot action game that became a huge hit in 1984 and was ported to various consoles, is now available on STEAM with a port of the original game and an Ultimate Evolution version that dramatically evolves the gameplay with enhanced graphics and sound!",

        "Detailed Description": "This is a game based on struggling and the unbending will of those who try. Unbeliever urges you to face the challenge of pushing through and conquering your obstacles. As you progress you recall your memories and with them your powers. You will learn to manipulate the elements and exploit your enemies' weaknesses. Each fight requires a unique approach. This is more of an action rather than a platform game and an experiment on 2D combat mechanics. You can dodge, push your enemies back, burn them, or even send them back through time. The efficiency of your powers depend on your character development choices and on what path you choose to specialize on. Earn the right to challenge the Unbeliever by slaying beings of great power. You start with nothing and fight your way to the top. The story is explained through the form of memories that you unlock by making progress in the game. You gain spells and experience to upgrade your stats.Your ultimate goal: find the Unbeliever that killed the Old Gods and get your memory back. Recall your memories as you delve deeper into this cursed world. With every little bit of progress you make, you will remember something. The lore of the world will be explained through the memories you recall. Some of them give you information about locations or enemies and some give you new spells. How you develop your character is entirely up to you. There are 7 different stats that you can invest in. Health: The amount of pain you can standPower: The potential to cast spells and tumbleAttack: The damage you deal with your regular attacksTechnique: Defines your attack speed, jump distance and dodge distanceHatred: Offensive spells increase the damage they dealGuilt: Affects trick spell parametersDefiance: Affects the most powerful and rare spells.

Now I have to lead my weary platoon back to our lines through the jungles and paddy fields. Entering what appears to be a friendly village - only to find it is a cover for a guerrilla faction - is just one of the things that helps our insomnia... that and the elusive psycho in my squad – I gotta figure out who he is before the morale factor becomes our worst enemy. Jeez, will this stupid war never end?! Back in the day when most games fell firmly into one camp such as shoot ‘em up, adventure, arcade action or map-based strategy, Lost Patrol was unusual in that it fused together elements of all these genres and more. With a combination of styles that tested a player’s entire gamut of skills, this 1990 release picked up fans on the popular platforms of the day – the Amiga, Atari ST and (for the relatively few PC gamers at the time) MS-DOS. Appearing in many ‘top 100’ lists, Lost Patrol is fondly remembered by those that played it, and is now available officially on Steam for the first time, courtesy of Pixel Games UK. The general action takes place on a military map, through which you are tasked with navigating a squad of men whose helicopter has crash-landed after an attack by the pesky guerrilla fighters. At certain points however the game field will switch view, requiring your arcade shooting skills, some hand-to-hand combat or other such surprises. Praised in its day for the quality of these additional graphic scenes, you’ll quickly realise why Lost Patrol is considered a retro classic!",

        "Detailed Description": "Hover Attack is a side-view robot shooter. Take control of an attacker with a limited number of bullets and try to destroy the target at the end of the game while killing enemies. When you run out of ammunition, you can replenish your supply by combining with your Carrier, and since the game is over even if your Carrier is hit by a certain number of bullets, it is important to keep your Carrier in a safe place. The original story was first published in 1984 in the PC magazine I/O (published by Kogaku-sha), and was so popular that it was ported to a number of consoles and later released as a commercial version. Many boys have dreamed at one time or another of being the pilot of a robot anime hero, such as Gundam. This game was so popular that it was later released in a much more powerful version, and ports were released for most of the major 8-bit PCs of the time. It is more than a one-on-one fighting game but less than a side-scrolling beat 'em up. The gameplay is unique in that there is a main character Attacker and a Carrier that the Attacker rides, and the two must work together to survive. The enemy can also deploy Attackers and Carriers that must be destroyed. The following three versions are included. * I/O version (port of the original) * Full version (port of the original) * The Ultimate Evolution version (a much-arranged version) In addition to the I/O version, there is also the Construction yesterday. Mods are also supported, so you can create the world you want and play with it.",

        "Detailed Description": "Deadlane is a horror/racing game which pits the player against five contestants in a race for survival. Inspired by asymmetrical horror games such as Dead by Daylight and beloved racing franchises such as Need for Speed. As a multiplayer horror-survival game, Deadlane aims to expand the genre by blurring the line between hunter and victim. At the start of each lap, the last-ranking racer will be transformed into the ghost racer known as Grim Prix. The Grim Prix curse holds many perks as it increases the player's speed while also being immune to on-road obstacles. However, the player possessing the Grim Prix curse will ultimately be eliminated at the end of the lap - regardless of where they ranked in the race. To avoid elimination, players must land a fired projectile into another player in order to pass the Grim Prix form onto them. The new Grim Prix will then teleport to the last-ranking position, starting the chase all over again. As each lap ends, playing as Grim Prix risks elimination. This cycle continues until only four survive until the final lap, in which 4 positions are decided - Gold, Silver, Bronze and the last to be eliminated. Some may wish to play as the hunter to gain an early lead, whereas others may want nothing to do with it all together. The choice is yours as only the most strategic racers are rewarded. Early Features: On-road obstacles such as evil spirits, who stalk every street and can spawn by racers at any given time. The freedom to choose from a wide gallery of atmospheric tracks, each as unforgiving as the last. A single player mode just as dynamic as its multiplayer counterpart, suited for those seeking a more focused experience. Time trials which forcefully test your ability to stay alive. And many more to come!",

        "Detailed Description": "The Darkness Confessed. S H R i M P is a third person platformer where you play as a Shrimp set in a bewildered VOID. You take on the mantle of completing a ritual that had been abandoned. Only the first step is clear of this ritual which is to collect all the cars. During this journey of collecting cars on levels you come across horrific entities roaming around trying to prevent you from completing the ritual. You cannot fight back or engage into combat. Best you can do is use your abilities to escape Death Struggles from the surreal entities or calm the Shrimp from gaining too much anxiety. Endure the trial and seek the truth. IMPORTANT MESSAGE S H R i M P receives updates from time to time and I plan to add so much more free content to the game. To clear the air for those that do not know. S H R i M P is game I developed solo back in 2020. It is my first ever full game and holds a special place in my heart. I spent 6 months on the project before publishing it. The game was completed from start to finish. Fast forward to now, I add free content updates for the game and do my best to listen to fans of the game and even put fan art in the game IF they are okay with it. Game Features: Basics The full game includes 20 levels total with loads of skins and headwear for the Shrimp. You can find some skins/headwear hidden on levels and buy them in the store with coins you pick up. There are three difficulties present in the game. There is Endurance, Purgatory and Sinner. Each difficulty adds a new challenge. These new challenges are detailed within the game’s difficulty screen. I did add a peaceful mode to the game so you can play the game and enjoy the atmosphere without entities around trying to stalk you. Furthermore, there is now level difficulty option which changes how hard the level will be. Mechanics The Stereo is the most important element to calming the Shrimp taking away the anxiety. Listening to music on the stereo is not mandatory on all levels while on some it is crucial you do. Anxiety plays a significant role on levels that contain entities such as the Porcelain Ghost and False Car. Another mechanics that will come to use is playing dead. Porcelain Ghost will ignore you when you play dead. Keep in mind if you do not play dead on time you will suffer the consequence. Shrimp is able to evolve and gain newer abilities progressing further into the game. These abilities will help you traverse levels efficiently. You will gain abilities as you move forward in the game. The Shrimp is equipped with a scanner so you will be able to scan around for cars. This scanner is upgradable if you want the scanner to detect other items or if you want to increase the radius. Other Things There is a lot this game offers beyond the surface level such as a detailed Index system. A currency converter to convert between different ones (All currencies are NOT microtransaction. There are NO microtransactions in the game rather these are currencies that you find in the game), an analyzation system, and tons of secrets left in the game left undiscovered. If you love exploring a game and getting lost in all the little things this game has a lot of that. These intricate systems do not need to be touched. If you choose to stay as a causal enjoyer that is fine, but if you want to see the depths of insanity of Shrimp's lore and what it has to offer it will be there for you.",

        "Detailed Description": "💕ONANIましょう👉👌 About the Game Monastery of Adelia Abbey, a group of exorcism experts known as the Battle Sister gather. One day, they receive a commission. The commission requests them to clear the emerging evil spirits in a cave, which has now become a mining site. The appearance of these evil spirits poses a threat to the kingdom's economic lifeline. Many miners have gathered there, urgently needing rescue. The one appointed for this task is the strongest battle sister, Leah. Leah is an exorcist who has been fighting evil spirits since childhood. She first arrives at the checkpoint near the cave entrance. There, temporary accommodation for miners and various facilities for preparing tools are set up. There is a natural hot spring, with male and female bath areas separated by only a curtain. In addition, there is a Brothel created to satisfy male needs, and more... Sister Leah, a devout sister dedicated to exorcism, whose life takes a sinful turn with lustful! This is a simple adult RPG based on exploring bases and dungeons. In the dungeon, there is no combat; you only need to chant magic to defeat enemies. However, in the cave, due to the influence of evil spirits, the air is filled with pheromone gas, and as you progress, the erotic becomes easier to increase. As the erotic increases, the consumption of magic points will sharply increase. (To make you defeat, super lusty poisonous swamps are placed throughout.) Use the skill to exorcise evil spirits with one blow. Erotic status - undergoes obvious changes with each H event! Change outfits obtained in the equipment screen, influencing character illustrations.",

        "Detailed Description": "Astro Hunters VR is a PvPvE extraction shooter set in space. Immerse yourself in the exploration of a unique planet, fight with different enemies, craft, gather resources, and upgrade your weapons. But remember, there are also other hunters on the planet. Will you ally, fight, or betray - it's up to you! Become one of the mercenaries called Hunters and help the Mothership achieve its objectives on the hostile planets. Undertake dangerous missions and challenge other players and in exchange freely scavenge the planets. You can join forces with other players, but be careful, hunting down other players to seize their valuable equipment is also an option! Going on an expedition comes with a high reward if you find valuable items, but it’s also high risk - if you die, you lose everything you have with you! Collect resources such as gases, liquids, metals, and others. Each of the resources has its special gathering tool . Use the collected items to craft new and better equipment. The Mothership provides you with crafting stations , on which you can craft inhalers, weapon parts, ammo and more. Do you want to store them, sell for good money, or trade with other players? The choice is yours! Gather a diverse range of weapons : pistols, rifles, rocket launchers, machine guns, shotguns, and snipers. Upgrade stats and customize them with elemental modifications : fire, plasma, electricity, and acid. Beware of other players lurking on the planets for your loot. To avoid being left with nothing, store some of them in your storage room to be ready for your next expedition. Take up the challenge and fight for the loot on the uncharted territories of a unique planet , brimming with diverse landscapes, challenging terrains, and protected bases full of precious items. Discover a wealth of resources, hunt, and engage in an intense fight against a multitude of enemies each presenting distinct challenges. Become one of the Hunters, and be the best!",

        "Detailed Description": "In this gym run by old Martín, former professional boxer, he will be the one who trains you to get the best out of you, you will test your agility, reflexes, concentration, coordination, patience, perseverance... in the three types of training it offers Until now the gym, he trains with the punching bag, the speed bag and the boxing ball. Improve your stats such as your strength, critical blows, aiming, defense and dodge blows to see them in action above the ring in each sparring match. Your gym mates will always give you good advice to lift your spirits and improve as a boxer, even though they are very rude in practice (sparring against the CPU). Notes from old Martin: Each boxer must complete rigorous training to get into the ring: Train with the punching bag to improve your strength and your critical blows. Train with the speed bag to improve your aiming and your defense. Train with the boxing ball to improve your dodge blows. Each training increases your energy and lowers your fatigue to improve your health recovery in sparring, improve your recovery after receiving a KO, improve your breathing to launch consecutive blows. If you want to face someone in sparring you need to train with the punching bag, the speed bag and the boxing ball to achieve at least: 15% of your strength on average. 25% of your aiming on average. 5% of your dodge blows on average. Despite the protections and rules of sparring... not being properly prepared would be dangerous and you wouldn't last a round. If you train hard, exceeding the minimum of your statistics to get into the ring, you will be more aware of your physical condition and that of your rival in sparring: 22.5% of your strength, 37.5% of your aiming and 7.5% of your dodge blows on average to display your health in combat. 30% of your strength, 50% of your aiming and 10% of your dodge blows on average to visualize your opponent's health and fatigue in combat. Try to get 100% of your potential and fill your fight history with victories.",

        "Detailed Description": "Canyons is a cooperative PvE game set in a procedurally generated post-apocalyptic world where survival is only possible in the canyons. Play solo or gather a team of up to four players. Arm yourselves to the teeth, grab supplies, and set out to conquer the canyons on massive Crawlers. CRAWLERS The vast waters disappeared hundreds of years ago, but the spirit of the pioneer ancestors and their inventions remain timeless. Become the captain of a Crawler—a colossal machine from the past, essential for traversing the canyons. Modify, upgrade, and develop your steel companion! Unless, of course, you find a better friend—here, sentimentality has no place. EXPEDITIONS Welcome to a world teeming with dangers, endless storms, scorching sun, fearsome creatures, and humans steeped in cruelty. You’re very welcome here, especially if you're tasty. Gather loyal friends, load ammo onto your rusty Crawler, and embark on expeditions to conquer, save, build, or destroy these damned canyons. Will you risk everything for legendary rewards, or will you wisely return home when things get tough? The choice is yours. There are no right decisions or proven paths here, but there is a complex procedural generation system with hand-crafted details and unique events that will let you feel the crunch of sand under your scurvy-ridden teeth over and over again. HAVEN No matter how brave a warrior you are, one day you'll have to return home. Establish your settlement in the canyon caves, equip it with everything survivors need, and they will gladly settle there. Build a shipyard for Crawler construction, garages for repair and tuning, an armory, or a fancy cafeteria with zombie burgers. Create infrastructure for traders, medics, workers, and more! And of course, ensure the protection of your home haven, as there will always be those who covet what you have. CAPTAIN Shooting is good, but shooting well is even better, and to achieve this, you must develop your captain. Besides improving basic stats, you can master dozens of professions, each enhancing your character in some aspect of the game. While shooting bottles and lifting weights, don’t forget about morality. The canyons are a harsh place, often forcing difficult choices. How will you treat a survivor dying of thirst? Give them precious water, take them to your harbor, rob them, leave them to the monsters, or even eat them yourself? The decision is yours! But remember, everything has consequences. INHABITANTS No matter how crazy an idea seems, it will always gather a group of followers. The canyons are no exception. The crowd here is peculiar. Lawmen, Marauders, the Diesel Cult, and many others await you on their lands. Or don’t—they might react uniquely to your actions and morality score. Find common ground with them, and they will aid you. For example, the Lawmen can provide the best equipment, the Diesel Cult can grant access to the finest transport and Crawler modules, and the Sun Fanatics will simply blow your head off—they are hated by everyone, and the feeling is mutual. Of course, humans are not the only inhabitants of these lands. In the canyons, you will encounter Shrivelled, Creepers, Savages, and many other creatures that mothers use to scare misbehaving children.",

        "Detailed Description": "Attacker, coward, swindler or endgame wizard: I'll show you how to win against anyone! After my World Championship victories in 2022 and 2023, I am the reigning Chess Software World Champion and am now looking forward to showing you how to become even stronger against your opponent With my innovative training method, I simulate typical player personalities you know from tournaments and online chess: brash attackers, cautious cowards, passive players. But how do you win against them? Fritz will show you how! And for beautiful attacks, combinations or sacrifices, there are the new ChessBase cards as a reward for you. Practical training that's also a lot of fun. Or let's train openings: you can try out a new repertoire ideas directly in a match against me. And how about the new calculation training for a quick Elo boost? As Fritz19 I can make you play better again. Fritz 18 marked the beginning of a new era, and Fritz 19 drives this development onward: a game against Fritz should be more than just a game - it should be an experience. In a time when online chess dominates, a chess program has to offer something special to be a real alternative to human opponents. In Fritz 19 it works like this There are six different characters that mimic typical club players: Allrounder, Aggressive, Positional, Swindler, Fearful, Endgame Expert. Fritz plays human moves that fit these types, but builds-in tactical mistakes so that you can win with a sacricial attack, for example. The sharper the position, the more likely the program will misstep. There is a wide range of tips and support that you can use to the full, or ignore, depending on your mood. With all the tips, you will practically always win against the “strong club player” level. If you ignore them completely, it becomes challenging for a player like me (ELO 2000). At any time during the game, you can switch to “assisted calculation” mode. Where is no clock, so you can train your calculation without stress in positions you have played yourself. This has an enormous training benefit. The opponent zoo The character Allrounder is probably the strongest opponent for every level of play. It is a development of “Easy Game” from Fritz 18. Everyone knows the Aggressive Player from their club. They regularly play on the attack, with a sharp opening repertoire. They are the ideal opponent for defence training with Black. The Swindler takes aggressiveness to the extreme, and o!en overplays the position. Material and solid position are of no interest, the main thing is to go for the king. Against this swindling fox, one usually has a material advantage, but suddenly it becomes highly dangerous. The wise owl symbolises the Positional Player. It loves a good pawn structure, a secure king of its own and coordinated piece-play. The distorted echo of this, is the fearful mouse. It appreciates crowded, safe positions and is afraid of complications. That is why it often plays weaker. The Endgame Fan, on the other hand, plays specifically for exchange. Simplification is paramount, the opening is o!en unambitious. When it comes to the endgame, on the other hand, things get really tough. An effective training opponent for this phase of the game! New opening training We all manage our opening repertoire in variation trees, stored in databases. If you want to play against it, it gets technical: opening books have to be converted. On today’s powerful computers, this has become obsolete. In Fritz 19, you play directly against databases, your own repertoire, or an opening article from the ChessBase Magazine! If the White player, the Black player, the tournament title, or the source begins with “White” or “Black”, then all the moves in this game belong to this colour. Fritz will then only play these moves. A repertoire is always rather narrow from the point of view of one’s own colour and broad for the opponent’s moves. Try it out: Your Najdorf repertoire with Black against the “aggressive” player! Tip for ChessBase users: Save a generated opening survey from ChessBase and play against it immediately What else is available The new engine in Fritz 19 is the Computer Chess World Champion for 2023. The Calculation Training has been extended, especially in the important preliminary query of candidate moves. The Buddy Engine and the annotated engine analysis from ChessBase 17 have found their way into Fritz. The notation (and the whole program interface) has been enormously enhanced in places. Tactical Analysis, the important full commentary of your games, has been improved and much more!",

The elemental deckbuilding system we've devised doesn't involve random card draws but instead requires a random draw of resources (elements of fire, water, earth, air) to use spells. This novel approach was recognized for its originality at the Google Indie Game Festival, offering a completely new deckbuilding experience. 🌈 Ether Element System Going beyond just drawing elements, a distinctive element called Ether makes the game even more rich. The nature of the Ether element is determined at the moment it is drawn, and it always triggers a draw of another element, potentially leading to a chain draw. 🏒 Overwhelming Variation and Freedom Lost Pages boasts an incredible number of various magic circles, artifacts, and runes. Depending on the user's choices, the deck changes freely. Such variation and freedom keep the gameplay constantly engaging, combined with the user's growing stats, offering unimaginably diverse experiences. ⚔️ 106 Levels for Endless Challenges Clearing just the six basic levels is a significant challenge, but the 100 levels of the Dimensional Gate mode remain as a goal for players to strive for, even years after release. 🎬 Unique Story and Beautiful Animation Lost Pages is the first installment in a series, grounded in a profound universe centered around the birth of the moon. Currently, it includes eight original animations, with more captivating story animations continuously being added. 🤓 Official Discord: 🤓 Contact Email: lostpages@jiffycrew.com 🤓 Privacy Policy: 🤓 Terms of Use:",

        "Detailed Description": "Synopsis: Isabella: Chasing Shadows is an adult visual novel story crafted as an erotic thriller, where your choices will matter, as you find yourself deeply entrenched in trying to uncover those responsible for the murder of your fiancée. Story: Life with your fiancée, who was a dedicated reporter, comes to a bitter end when a tragic hit-and-run claims her life. Despite the police closing the case as a mere accident, you are haunted by the lingering suspicion of murder that they've failed to investigate. Determined to unveil the truth, you’ll embark on a relentless pursuit for justice, using your skills and enlisting the help of both old and new allies in your quest. As you delve ever deeper into the city’s dark underbelly, you’ll encounter a captivating supermodel; you’ll rely on an old friend wielding incredible resources and on a network of shadowy figures. Will you be able to uncover the dark secrets of the city you once loved? And the most important question is: Will you seek justice for your lost love… or… will you succumb to the allure of revenge? Gameplay This is a game where your choices matter! Every decision you make will affect how the game proceeds and how people will behave towards you. And, in the end, those choices will determine if you choose the path of JUSTICE or one of REVENGE. These choices also include the relationships you’ll have, such as: Alex, your naughty ‘Friend with benefits’, or maybe you’ll choose a solo path with Isabella, a ‘world class model’ who needs your help… or, perhaps you’ll have a relationship with both… the choice is yours in this story driven game where your choices really do matter. Main Characters The MC (you) – The Problem Solver Answer Seeker Surviving from a rough childhood and getting training in the military, you’ve made for yourself quite a fortune with software development. Things were perfect for you… an exciting career, money and a fiancée that you loved and were going to marry. You lost yourself the day she died, you shrugged of the care and concern that your loved ones sent your way; but one person was able to pull you from the prison of solitude you’d locked yourself behind, Alex… Alexandria “Alex” – A Sassy but Cute Troublemaker Not everything is as it seems with the woman who’s stood beside you and nursed you back into the world after the death of your fiancée… She carries with her a troubling and checkered past that you’ll begin to uncover. Will you continue to stand beside and count on her as you learn more about her, or will your focus travel elsewhere? Isabella “Isa” – Supermodel of the Year Confident and beautiful, but also in trouble! Not happy with her current management, Isa seeks to break ties and start anew, but those who hold her contract aren’t willing to release her and will stop at nothing to make sure she doesn’t leave. Will you be able to help her from the mess that she's entangled in, or will you leave her fend for herself against shady men and stalkers? Side Characters: Valerie “Val” – News Reporter Your fiancée’s old co-worker, who has an interest in helping to uncover the truth if it is to be found and has an interest in you as well. William “Wil” – Ex-Military Ex-Cop There is more than meets the eye with Wil, particularly when it comes to the things he knows. Just who is this man and just what kind of connections does he have? Trisha “Trish” – Detective Niece of ‘Wil’ and a possible connection to getting the answers you need from a corrupt police department. Annoushka – Ex-Fashion Model Fearing for her life, what connection can this young woman have to everything that has happened? Nicolai – The Devil We Know Sometimes to kill a snake it takes a BIGGER snake… and, at least, you know where you stand with this one. But… at what cost? Matteo – Isa’s Uncle Responsible for getting Isabella into modelling, but what is in it for him… why do you get a bad vibe with this guy? The Coopers – Senior Junior The Main Antagonists and it feels like they own the entire city… just how far does their reach extend? For what purpose? And does it have anything to do with the death of your fiancée?",

        "Detailed Description": "Massive, multiplayer, online, role-playing game in an open world. After choosing a character, go on an adventure. Mine and manufacture resources. Produce materials, engines, weapons and ammo. Explore the world using airships and aircraft. To move quickly, use strekolets or jump through the Gate. Live in the cities of the world or build your own settlement. Open up new possibilities by developing your character's skills. The fate of the world is in your hands! Many years ago, the Guardians left the world of the Edge of the Inside Out, leaving behind grains of magic, rare objects, and artifacts. The Bastions continue to control the territories. Flocks of dragons burn caravans and settlements caught on their path of fiery migration. The Outcasts seize border towns, shaking the fragile truce between the Empire and the Union. Minions are searching for particles of the Inside Out, bringing the world closer to the apocalypse. Character The race you choose affects where you first appear in the world - in the game, geography means a lot! Player grows their abilities by learning skills. Travel This is a game about adventures in the air — using ships, airships, or strekolets. The world is open and without restriction. Instant travel from one point of the world to another is available through the Gate if you have purchased a Sapphire. Open World The area of the world is 1,000,000 square kilometers! The world is divided into two continents, several islands and archipelagos. The Navigator will show you the world at a glance. Each race, or faction, has two capitals - located on different parts of the map. Cities and Settlements Cities are located along the caravan routes, offering protection, production facilities, and storage for your property. Access to cities directly depends on a character’s reputation. By purchasing a license, a character can build their own settlement in any vacant and suitable place. Your own settlement provides more opportunities than an existing city. Each floating island has a city with unique capabilities. There also are cities that sell rare magical items and upgrades! Aircraft There are dozens of ships and airships in the game world. They all differ in class and characteristics. Yachts are heavy transporters with a large hold capacity, that are distinguished by their speed and maneuverability. Warships are equipped with much more weapons. Strekolets can be used for reconnaissance, fast movement, bombing, or a surprise missile and torpedo strike on a target. Guilds It isn’t just player characters that can join guilds, but also NPC. Prominent representatives of NPC guilds: Merchants, Outcasts, Demon Minions, Dragon Flocks. Events A bastion is a monumental complex with regeneration capabilities. Each bastion controls one of the world’s territories. A bastion generates rare items and collects taxes from all mined resources in the territory into its warehouse. Big races are mass strekolet races with no restrictions on the type and modifications of those. The use of magic and weapons is allowed. Bounty hunters destroy the property of outlaw captains for a reward. War is a battle between the fleets of the border cities. But also - a great opportunity to earn some money or capture a ship of your liking! Migration - four times a year, the world comes to a standstill. Thousands of dragons leave their nests to search for better places. During this time, dragons will fly right into your path! Lottery 6 out of 36 - a chance to hit the jackpot! Seasonally planned events and activities.",

        "Detailed Description": "Monologue is a visual novel that immerses the reader in a world of internal struggles and hopes, tinged with sadness, but with the possibility of a brighter tomorrow. This story of a sad man celebrating the new year alone serves as a reminder of the importance of caring for each other and spreading kindness around us. Indeed, in the darkness of loneliness, a holiday can become the most difficult test for those who are left without help and support. The plot develops through the hero's inner thoughts, memories of past New Year's evenings with loved ones, and hope for change in the future. The meeting of midnight becomes a point of revision for the protagonist, an opportunity to find meaning in his loneliness and find a path to his own happiness. On the night of December 31 to January 1, the hero of our story finds himself alone in his small apartment. The whole city shines with bright lights, and the streets are filled with laughter and joy of welcoming the new year. However he standing on his balcony, feels only a sad atmosphere around. This visual novel is a short but vivid immersion into the world of loneliness during a festive moment. Completing the game leaves the player with a deep sense of reflection and perhaps a unique insight into their own experiences in similar moments.",

Only the main character's partner possesses the cheat move called Cheat Tackle. It ensures a guaranteed first strike and a one-hit kill. In the easy mode, you can even use it endlessly! In this world, there exists mystical creatures known as Yarimon. Known as the loner protagonist with the weakest Yarimon... until now, that is. In a surprising turn of events, the protagonist's Yarimon partner learned a godly-powerful move with a power level of 800,000 called the Cheat Tackle. With this, the protagonist's world completely changed, as this move will one-shot any opponent in battle (though it is only usable once per battle). Of course, it would be foolish to believe that one can become the champion with just a single move. Therefore, a trainer must continue to hone their skills and diversify their strategies. With that said, defeating my childhood friend for the first time is already a crazy accomplishment. I can finally get back some of the money I lost to her... Afterwards, I set out on an adventure after my childhood friend told me she was going on a journey and pressured me to do the same. As I am adventuring, I slowly unravel the secret of this world. This is when I felt like my journey had really begun. Aim to complete the Yarimon Encyclopedia (Yaridex)!!

        "Detailed Description": "Age of Water - Gold Edition Includes 3000 Corks and 250 000 Medallions. Corks will come in handy when you need to buy in-game resources from vendors and repair your ship, whereas medallions can be used to purchase decorations. Please note that there are no microtransactions in the game, and both currencies can only be earned via gameplay. Replaces four common starting boats with upgraded boats of the Barracuda team and three ordinary crew members with crewmen from the Barracuda team. More advanced boats can only be earned via gameplay. 3000 corks; 250 000 medallions (on top of 20 000 medallions from standard edition) Upgraded version of the crew: a skin for Alter Ego, Kitty Sark and Jack Wiley. Upgraded version of the crew: Alter Ego, Kitty Sark and Jack Wiley will have some different skills on early levels compared to the base edition of the game. On later levels the crew stats of both editions become the same. Start with Pirate Boat (instead of Rubber boat) Better Dory boat will be given in the prologue upon completing the quest New Boat; Bigger and sturdier boat (Skadi Boat or Sofiya Longboat) is given upon completion of the shipwright quest We Need a Bigger Boat (instead of Njord Boat or Sonja Longboat). Note! Those additional boats (Dory, Skadi Boat, Sofiya Longboat) will be available for construction on the base. About the Game Become a sea captain on a post-apocalyptic Earth completely covered in water and go on an adventure in a huge open world. Sail through storms, fight and trade, capture other people's boats or build your own, extract resources from the bottom of the ocean, reveal the secrets of the Age of Water world. Water post-apocalypse The ocean destroyed a once great civilization, but people survived and adapted. They built settlements on the roofs of tall buildings and the tops of other man-made structures. People travel across the ocean in tiny boats and huge combat vessels. The ocean provides everything they need, including extractable resources on the seabed. And yet, the dream of real land is still alive. True open world Explore the world at your own pace, discover new settlements and meet their inhabitants. Complete tasks, search for and extract valuable resources from the bottom of the ocean, earn money on trade or simply sell the artifacts you have obtained, and when you get the idea of how this world works, build your own base. Hundreds of unique ships Build boats from scratch or modify existing ones. Players have access to dozens of hulls and hundreds of parts, from which they can assemble anything ranging from a small boat to a hefty vessel 30 meters long, and then install equipment, armor and weapons. It’s important not to forget to gather a team of good crewmembers so that there is someone to stand behind machine guns and cannons or do other work on board. Fierce naval battles Pirates are always waiting for you at sea, and in some cases more aggressive players even start to chase you, so do not forget to install enough guns on your deck. You can destroy an enemy vessel, or you can capture it in battle and take it for yourself forever. Adventures might also get you into storming enemy fortresses and defending allied settlements! Personal naval base This shelter is reliably protected from enemies, and it allows a player to organize the production of everything that the captain may need on it. Build factories for the production of equipment, weapons, hulls for boats of all sizes, as well as the necessary resources. Flexible balance between PvE and PvP At first, you will only meet computer opponents, but later you can challenge other players if you are confident enough in your skills and gear. Always be on the lookout: if your task is to transport illegal goods, then other players may well take the quest to hunt smugglers. In Age of Water, everyone decides for themself who they are today - a peaceful traveler or a bloodthirsty pirate.",
