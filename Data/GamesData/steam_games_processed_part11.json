        "Detailed Description": "ADD FULL GAME TO YOUR WISHLIST About the Game We are developing this short experience into a new full game called Imagined Leviathans, which will greatly develop the gameplay and themes into a full 2-3 hours of play, with improved visuals and significantly more to do and see, including meeting other survivors “At fifty degrees below zero frostbite can strike in as few as five minutes” A poetic survival horror set in a future where climate change has rendered Britain an arctic wasteland. On your pilgrimage to Steel Henge you can only take what you can carry, so choose carefully what you leave behind. Immerse yourself in this starkly monochromatic world as you scavenge for fuel, take shelter in the shadows, and burn stories to stay warm. A malevolent presence lurks between the words, just out of reach. Alone, you must sacrifice everything you knew to deliver the bitter truth of this world to future generations. A brief but intense 20 minutes.",

Unbeliever urges you to face the challenge of pushing through and conquering your obstacles. As you progress you recall your memories and with them your powers. You will learn to manipulate the elements and exploit your enemies' weaknesses. Each fight requires a unique approach. This is more of an action rather than a platform game and an experiment on 2D combat mechanics. You can dodge, push your enemies back, burn them, or even send them back through time. The efficiency of your powers depend on your character development choices and on what path you choose to specialize on. Earn the right to challenge the Unbeliever by slaying beings of great power. You start with nothing and fight your way to the top. The story is explained through the form of memories that you unlock by making progress in the game. You gain spells and experience to upgrade your stats.Your ultimate goal: find the Unbeliever that killed the Old Gods and get your memory back. Recall your memories as you delve deeper into this cursed world. With every little bit of progress you make, you will remember something. The lore of the world will be explained through the memories you recall. Some of them give you information about locations or enemies and some give you new spells. How you develop your character is entirely up to you. There are 7 different stats that you can invest in. Health: The amount of pain you can standPower: The potential to cast spells and tumbleAttack: The damage you deal with your regular attacksTechnique: Defines your attack speed, jump distance and dodge distanceHatred: Offensive spells increase the damage they dealGuilt: Affects trick spell parametersDefiance: Affects the most powerful and rare spells.

Unbeliever urges you to face the challenge of pushing through and conquering your obstacles. As you progress you recall your memories and with them your powers. You will learn to manipulate the elements and exploit your enemies' weaknesses. Each fight requires a unique approach. This is more of an action rather than a platform game and an experiment on 2D combat mechanics. You can dodge, push your enemies back, burn them, or even send them back through time. The efficiency of your powers depend on your character development choices and on what path you choose to specialize on. Earn the right to challenge the Unbeliever by slaying beings of great power. You start with nothing and fight your way to the top. The story is explained through the form of memories that you unlock by making progress in the game. You gain spells and experience to upgrade your stats.Your ultimate goal: find the Unbeliever that killed the Old Gods and get your memory back. Recall your memories as you delve deeper into this cursed world. With every little bit of progress you make, you will remember something. The lore of the world will be explained through the memories you recall. Some of them give you information about locations or enemies and some give you new spells. How you develop your character is entirely up to you. There are 7 different stats that you can invest in. Health: The amount of pain you can standPower: The potential to cast spells and tumbleAttack: The damage you deal with your regular attacksTechnique: Defines your attack speed, jump distance and dodge distanceHatred: Offensive spells increase the damage they dealGuilt: Affects trick spell parametersDefiance: Affects the most powerful and rare spells.

        "Detailed Description": "Our chopper tailed-out after taking a hit... the pilot won’t be leaving the ground again. Now I have to lead my weary platoon back to our lines through the jungles and paddy fields. Entering what appears to be a friendly village - only to find it is a cover for a guerrilla faction - is just one of the things that helps our insomnia... that and the elusive psycho in my squad – I gotta figure out who he is before the morale factor becomes our worst enemy. Jeez, will this stupid war never end?! Back in the day when most games fell firmly into one camp such as shoot ‘em up, adventure, arcade action or map-based strategy, Lost Patrol was unusual in that it fused together elements of all these genres and more. With a combination of styles that tested a player’s entire gamut of skills, this 1990 release picked up fans on the popular platforms of the day – the Amiga, Atari ST and (for the relatively few PC gamers at the time) MS-DOS. Appearing in many ‘top 100’ lists, Lost Patrol is fondly remembered by those that played it, and is now available officially on Steam for the first time, courtesy of Pixel Games UK. The general action takes place on a military map, through which you are tasked with navigating a squad of men whose helicopter has crash-landed after an attack by the pesky guerrilla fighters. At certain points however the game field will switch view, requiring your arcade shooting skills, some hand-to-hand combat or other such surprises. Praised in its day for the quality of these additional graphic scenes, you’ll quickly realise why Lost Patrol is considered a retro classic!",
        "Short Description": "We’re fit, we’re alive, but we’re not back home In this classic multi-genre DOS game, take command of the seven survivors of a U.S. helicopter crash in Vietnam, desperately trekking across 57 miles of harsh terrain infested with booby traps and enemy soldiers.",

Praised in its day for the quality of these additional graphic scenes, you’ll quickly realise why Lost Patrol is considered a retro classic!",

When you run out of ammunition, you can replenish your supply by combining with your Carrier, and since the game is over even if your Carrier is hit by a certain number of bullets, it is important to keep your Carrier in a safe place. The original story was first published in 1984 in the PC magazine I/O (published by Kogaku-sha), and was so popular that it was ported to a number of consoles and later released as a commercial version. Many boys have dreamed at one time or another of being the pilot of a robot anime hero, such as Gundam. This game was so popular that it was later released in a much more powerful version, and ports were released for most of the major 8-bit PCs of the time. It is more than a one-on-one fighting game but less than a side-scrolling beat 'em up. The gameplay is unique in that there is a main character Attacker and a Carrier that the Attacker rides, and the two must work together to survive. The enemy can also deploy Attackers and Carriers that must be destroyed. The following three versions are included. * I/O version (port of the original) * Full version (port of the original) * The Ultimate Evolution version (a much-arranged version) In addition to the I/O version, there is also the Construction yesterday. Mods are also supported, so you can create the world you want and play with it.",
        "Short Description": "Hover Attack, the definitive version of the robot action game that became a huge hit in 1984 and was ported to various consoles, is now available on STEAM with a port of the original game and an Ultimate Evolution version that dramatically evolves the gameplay with enhanced graphics and sound!",

        "Detailed Description": "This is a game based on struggling and the unbending will of those who try. Unbeliever urges you to face the challenge of pushing through and conquering your obstacles. As you progress you recall your memories and with them your powers. You will learn to manipulate the elements and exploit your enemies' weaknesses. Each fight requires a unique approach. This is more of an action rather than a platform game and an experiment on 2D combat mechanics. You can dodge, push your enemies back, burn them, or even send them back through time. The efficiency of your powers depend on your character development choices and on what path you choose to specialize on. Earn the right to challenge the Unbeliever by slaying beings of great power. You start with nothing and fight your way to the top. The story is explained through the form of memories that you unlock by making progress in the game. You gain spells and experience to upgrade your stats.Your ultimate goal: find the Unbeliever that killed the Old Gods and get your memory back. Recall your memories as you delve deeper into this cursed world. With every little bit of progress you make, you will remember something. The lore of the world will be explained through the memories you recall. Some of them give you information about locations or enemies and some give you new spells. How you develop your character is entirely up to you. There are 7 different stats that you can invest in. Health: The amount of pain you can standPower: The potential to cast spells and tumbleAttack: The damage you deal with your regular attacksTechnique: Defines your attack speed, jump distance and dodge distanceHatred: Offensive spells increase the damage they dealGuilt: Affects trick spell parametersDefiance: Affects the most powerful and rare spells.

Now I have to lead my weary platoon back to our lines through the jungles and paddy fields. Entering what appears to be a friendly village - only to find it is a cover for a guerrilla faction - is just one of the things that helps our insomnia... that and the elusive psycho in my squad – I gotta figure out who he is before the morale factor becomes our worst enemy. Jeez, will this stupid war never end?! Back in the day when most games fell firmly into one camp such as shoot ‘em up, adventure, arcade action or map-based strategy, Lost Patrol was unusual in that it fused together elements of all these genres and more. With a combination of styles that tested a player’s entire gamut of skills, this 1990 release picked up fans on the popular platforms of the day – the Amiga, Atari ST and (for the relatively few PC gamers at the time) MS-DOS. Appearing in many ‘top 100’ lists, Lost Patrol is fondly remembered by those that played it, and is now available officially on Steam for the first time, courtesy of Pixel Games UK. The general action takes place on a military map, through which you are tasked with navigating a squad of men whose helicopter has crash-landed after an attack by the pesky guerrilla fighters. At certain points however the game field will switch view, requiring your arcade shooting skills, some hand-to-hand combat or other such surprises. Praised in its day for the quality of these additional graphic scenes, you’ll quickly realise why Lost Patrol is considered a retro classic!",

        "Detailed Description": "Hover Attack is a side-view robot shooter. Take control of an attacker with a limited number of bullets and try to destroy the target at the end of the game while killing enemies. When you run out of ammunition, you can replenish your supply by combining with your Carrier, and since the game is over even if your Carrier is hit by a certain number of bullets, it is important to keep your Carrier in a safe place. The original story was first published in 1984 in the PC magazine I/O (published by Kogaku-sha), and was so popular that it was ported to a number of consoles and later released as a commercial version. Many boys have dreamed at one time or another of being the pilot of a robot anime hero, such as Gundam. This game was so popular that it was later released in a much more powerful version, and ports were released for most of the major 8-bit PCs of the time. It is more than a one-on-one fighting game but less than a side-scrolling beat 'em up. The gameplay is unique in that there is a main character Attacker and a Carrier that the Attacker rides, and the two must work together to survive. The enemy can also deploy Attackers and Carriers that must be destroyed. The following three versions are included. * I/O version (port of the original) * Full version (port of the original) * The Ultimate Evolution version (a much-arranged version) In addition to the I/O version, there is also the Construction yesterday. Mods are also supported, so you can create the world you want and play with it.",

        "Detailed Description": "Deadlane is a horror/racing game which pits the player against five contestants in a race for survival. Inspired by asymmetrical horror games such as Dead by Daylight and beloved racing franchises such as Need for Speed. As a multiplayer horror-survival game, Deadlane aims to expand the genre by blurring the line between hunter and victim. At the start of each lap, the last-ranking racer will be transformed into the ghost racer known as Grim Prix. The Grim Prix curse holds many perks as it increases the player's speed while also being immune to on-road obstacles. However, the player possessing the Grim Prix curse will ultimately be eliminated at the end of the lap - regardless of where they ranked in the race. To avoid elimination, players must land a fired projectile into another player in order to pass the Grim Prix form onto them. The new Grim Prix will then teleport to the last-ranking position, starting the chase all over again. As each lap ends, playing as Grim Prix risks elimination. This cycle continues until only four survive until the final lap, in which 4 positions are decided - Gold, Silver, Bronze and the last to be eliminated. Some may wish to play as the hunter to gain an early lead, whereas others may want nothing to do with it all together. The choice is yours as only the most strategic racers are rewarded. Early Features: On-road obstacles such as evil spirits, who stalk every street and can spawn by racers at any given time. The freedom to choose from a wide gallery of atmospheric tracks, each as unforgiving as the last. A single player mode just as dynamic as its multiplayer counterpart, suited for those seeking a more focused experience. Time trials which forcefully test your ability to stay alive. And many more to come!",

        "Detailed Description": "The Darkness Confessed. S H R i M P is a third person platformer where you play as a Shrimp set in a bewildered VOID. You take on the mantle of completing a ritual that had been abandoned. Only the first step is clear of this ritual which is to collect all the cars. During this journey of collecting cars on levels you come across horrific entities roaming around trying to prevent you from completing the ritual. You cannot fight back or engage into combat. Best you can do is use your abilities to escape Death Struggles from the surreal entities or calm the Shrimp from gaining too much anxiety. Endure the trial and seek the truth. IMPORTANT MESSAGE S H R i M P receives updates from time to time and I plan to add so much more free content to the game. To clear the air for those that do not know. S H R i M P is game I developed solo back in 2020. It is my first ever full game and holds a special place in my heart. I spent 6 months on the project before publishing it. The game was completed from start to finish. Fast forward to now, I add free content updates for the game and do my best to listen to fans of the game and even put fan art in the game IF they are okay with it. Game Features: Basics The full game includes 20 levels total with loads of skins and headwear for the Shrimp. You can find some skins/headwear hidden on levels and buy them in the store with coins you pick up. There are three difficulties present in the game. There is Endurance, Purgatory and Sinner. Each difficulty adds a new challenge. These new challenges are detailed within the game’s difficulty screen. I did add a peaceful mode to the game so you can play the game and enjoy the atmosphere without entities around trying to stalk you. Furthermore, there is now level difficulty option which changes how hard the level will be. Mechanics The Stereo is the most important element to calming the Shrimp taking away the anxiety. Listening to music on the stereo is not mandatory on all levels while on some it is crucial you do. Anxiety plays a significant role on levels that contain entities such as the Porcelain Ghost and False Car. Another mechanics that will come to use is playing dead. Porcelain Ghost will ignore you when you play dead. Keep in mind if you do not play dead on time you will suffer the consequence. Shrimp is able to evolve and gain newer abilities progressing further into the game. These abilities will help you traverse levels efficiently. You will gain abilities as you move forward in the game. The Shrimp is equipped with a scanner so you will be able to scan around for cars. This scanner is upgradable if you want the scanner to detect other items or if you want to increase the radius. Other Things There is a lot this game offers beyond the surface level such as a detailed Index system. A currency converter to convert between different ones (All currencies are NOT microtransaction. There are NO microtransactions in the game rather these are currencies that you find in the game), an analyzation system, and tons of secrets left in the game left undiscovered. If you love exploring a game and getting lost in all the little things this game has a lot of that. These intricate systems do not need to be touched. If you choose to stay as a causal enjoyer that is fine, but if you want to see the depths of insanity of Shrimp's lore and what it has to offer it will be there for you.",
