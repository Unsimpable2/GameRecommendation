        "Detailed Description": "An action-rhythm-puzzle-platform game that will test your skills and your patience as the game’s developer talks you through each screen. However, there may be more to this simple world of screens than what meets the eye, and this so-called developer may have motives of his own.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n - Over 100 challenging levels – you will die. A lot.\r\n - A peculiar story about facing the realities of life.\r\n - Every level a puzzle – you must decipher the pattern behind each level to progress.\r\n - An extraordinary original sound track by the amazingly talented Caleb Klomparens.\r\n - Everything is synced with the music – use this to help get into the flow of the levels.\r\n - A separate Free Play mode where you can try to play each chapter with the least amount of deaths and/or best time.\r\n\r\nFAQ:\r\n\r\nQ - Those colorful effects look cool, but they may be a bit much.\r\nA - For those that are prone to seizures, or pro players who want a cleaner experience, a majority of the effects can be disabled in the Options menu.\r\n\r\nQ - How many levels are there?\r\nA - 103, 90 levels in the story plus 13 bonus levels.\r\n\r\nQ - What is the estimated play time?\r\nA - The average is about 3 hours. However, because the game is so difficult, play time can vary wildly from player to player. Some people have taken upwards of 6 hours, while the fastest we've seen someone beat it is 1 hour.\r\n\r\nQ - Is there a way to just play through the levels without all of the story stuff?\r\nA - Yes, you can play Free Play mode from the beginning, where story elements are disabled.\r\n\r\nQ - The player character has a &quot;01&quot; on it, does that mean there will be multiplayer?\r\nA - The &quot;01&quot; on the player is story related. There is currently no multiplayer. Multiplayer for Free Play mode was in the works for some time, but was cut due to time restraints. We *may* release it later on as a patch.\r\n\r\nQ - Can I play this game on my Youtube or Twitch channel?\r\nA - YES! Free marketing is always appreciated. Feel free to monetize the video too. Just make sure to link the Steam page in the description or in the video.",

Build your own, masterfully thought-out base, destroy the enemy spawns or base in organized attacks, hunt down your enemies and emerge victorious!Pro tip: Do not attack all by yourself, especially as a human!Game mechanicsThis game contains numerous in-game mechanics, and therefore, for the sake of keeping it short but informational, not everything is going to be described. Both teams are COMPLETELY different from each other and thus require to field different tactics in order to defeat their enemies.HumansHumans have a stamina system. Stamina is depleted by sprinting or jumping. Every human has one medikit (bind key: F) and a new one is added to your inventory once fully healed by a Medi.Damage system: human body is divided into three parts: head/body/legs, with each part sustaining different damage values.Note: Flamer can change flame to diesel style!AliensAliens do not have a stamina system, therefore they can run and jump freely to their hearts’ content. Any tissue damage inflicted to an alien is regenerated on its own. Certain aliens are capable of wall-climbing.Damage system: Their body is a SINGLE damage system, thus damage to the head and to its legs does not differ.Note: Growing furs!StageBoth teams begin at Stage 1. Higher Stages (2 &amp; 3) allow both teams to field more advanced weaponry/aliens and to build strong and useful structures. Higher stages are achieved by killing a certain amount of enemies – the more players present in your team, the more kills are required.CreditsHumans gain credits by killing enemies (a stronger enemy killed gives you higher rewards), by destroying enemy spawns/the &quot;Overmind&quot; as well as with 2 minutes passed in-game. Credits can be used to buy weapons, armor and other equipment in the buildable structure called &quot;Armoury&quot;.EvosAliens gain evos by killing enemies, by destroying enemy spawns/the &quot;Reactor&quot; as well as with every 2 minutes that pass. Evos are used to evolve into a &quot;higher&quot; Alien ONLY.Buildable structuresPlayers can build structures only with spare build points (BP) to use and only prior to Sudden Death (SD makes it impossible to build anything else, the standard timelimit for the SD is 30 min).With the Construction Kit, humans are able to build various technological structures. The main structure is the Reactor. Without a Reactor, the human base is powerless and dysfunctional, apart from spawns. The most important structure is the Node – a human spawn. Without Nodes, humans are unable to spawn – a sign of their possible doom. Humans are able to build structures only in the power range of the Reactor, extensible by the Repeater. Any damaged human structures must be healed by a Builder ASAP!With the Granger/Advanced Granger, aliens build their own structures. The main structure is the Overmind. Without an Overmind, the base is left without a mind - no structures apart from spawns work and Mur is unable to fly. The most important structure is the Egg – an alien spawn. Without eggs, aliens cannot spawn and thus may soon get exterminated. Aliens can build structures only in the range of the Overmind or Eggs. Eggs can be built anywhere and have their own range. Any damaged alien structures are regenerated on their own! A structure that loses the range of an Overmind or an Egg self-destructs after a while!DebuffsMost debuffs are intended for humans only. Please, check the bottom left corner of your screen when anything &quot;odd&quot; happens to your character. You may find yourself paralyzed, on fire, slowed down, poisoned, webbed etc. In order to get rid of them, sometimes you just have to wait for the debuffs to disappear. Sometimes,you will have to jump into the water, or you will have to jump.

Defeat hordes of enemies, from foot soldiers to mighty dragons, to make your way through a mysterious tower that appeared out of nowhere. Discover its secrets and stop the evil Scak from accomplishing his plan that would seal Interia's fate.General GameplaySuncore Chronicles: The Tower mixes several genres to give a fresh and unique gameplay experience. Beside classical action adventure elements like puzzle solving, minigames, combat and looting in a third person setting, the game also includes several other gameplay elements. Those involve platforming sections with 2D movement or &quot;Beat em up&quot; styled levels, which are influenced by the good old console or arcade classics.Combat SystemSuncore Chronicles: The Tower has a fast paced realtime combat system, focussing on dodging enemy abilities, crowd control and using your strong abilities if the timing and positioning allows for it. The numerous bosses require the player to figure out the mechanics and timings to be able to succeed. The game also includes special dungeons meant for group play, which can require a whole group of four players to coordinate their actions in a reasonable way.Specializations and SkillsThe player can change between four different specializations at any time in the game, which include two melee classes and two more range oriented caster classes. Each class has their own abilities, which can be learned throughout the game. Abilities can be leveled up to increase their strength and add additional perks. In addition, each class has a specific strength like inceased health or a higher chance to perform critical strikes.Equipment SystemEach enemy in the game can drop loot of different kind and quality, including armor, weapons, materials for upgrades, runes, recipes for runewords and more. The player can save all of his equipment in sets, which (like the specialization) can be changed at any time to fit the current play style. High quality pieces of equipment can modify player abilities, proc certain effects or even form powerful sets.Development PhilosophyThe base version of the game is free to play, allowing the player to get to know the main features and feeling of the game. However, the world is restricted to the starting areas, including two tutorial sections and the first world regions. The game will be extended frequently with low cost DLCs that include new features and add more regions, enemies and of course loot.For optimal experience, it is recommended to play with a gamepad.",

        "Detailed Description": "Inspired by the rise of fake news, social media echo chambers, and the displacement of truth, Orwell: Ignorance is Strength is the second--darker--season of the award-winning surveillance thriller, Orwell. With the power to both uncover and play with &quot;the truth&quot;, you must decide for yourself how far you will go in the service of your country and whether the truth is sacred or ignorance is strength.Inducted into “The Office”--a top-secret department of the government’s Orwell security program--you’ll take on the role of an investigative agent during a time when civil unrest threatens to become a major political crisis between the Nation and neighboring country Parges. Reporting directly to Orwell adviser, Ampleford, you‘re tasked with uncovering the truth behind the escalating political tension, and delving deep into the lives of Raban Vhart, editor of The People’s Voice and self-proclaimed guardian of truth, his wife, Karen, and his brother, Illya, to uncover their potential involvement. To assist you in your task, you will be given new tools and mechanics that provide opportunities to control and impact the narrative. A new “time of day” system puts you in time-sensitive situations, making who you chose to investigate and when, more important than ever. You can also research more widely and dig deeper into citizen’s lives, gathering additional information to influence the way events are reported and perceived by the public.FEATURES:Investigate the agitators - Enter the world of Orwell and join a top-secret department of agents known as “The Office” during a time of civil unrest and political tension.

Identify the hidden agendas of all those involved and expose them. Manipulate the information - Use Orwell’s upgraded toolset and the information you have uncovered to create your own version of the truth. Then use that to gain influence and control over the situation.End the threat - Expose the truth.

Put an end to the civil unrest threatening to destroy the Nation.Releasing over three episodes - The game will release on PC, Mac and Linux across three bi-weekly episodes, with episode one available February 22. Be part of the investigation as it unfolds.Praise for Orwell:“Grabs the problem of how we balance our own liberty and our safety and turns it into a thrilling adventure.” – Polygon“In an age where so much personal information is willingly released by so many, Orwell brilliantly explores the implications of this data being misinterpreted.” – GameSpot&quot;A harrowing look into a reality where Big Brother is always watching&quot; - Rock Paper Shotgun",

        "Detailed Description": "Welcome to Praslav, a cold Central European city that grows even colder with the coming winter. Praslav is recovering from the political turmoil that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Communist regime, which held the country in its iron grip for decades. While most people eagerly awaited the coming of democracy and capitalism, some were unable to adapt to the new socio-economic climate. Soon they found themselves on the streets with nowhere to go. You are one of those people.Keep an eye on your needs and other variables, which interact in realistic ways - staying warm, dry, and well-fed are not your only concerns. Poor hygiene and dirty clothes make you smellier, low temperature increases the risk of falling ill, and whatever piece of food comes in must also come out at some point.How far are you willing to go to survive? Steal, burgle, and consort with criminals of all sorts. If necessary, take what you need by force. However, you are not an action hero. Consider your actions carefully, for the consequences are often severe, and benefits rarely outweigh the risks. Most importantly, keep your wits about you. Even if you are not willing to hurt people for personal gain, others are.Spend the last few days of autumn wisely – gather supplies, equipment, and materials to help you survive the most difficult of seasons. Weather is unpredictable, but there is one certainty - every day is colder than the last. With a lot of preparation and a bit of luck, you might even see the spring again. Unlike other survival games, Hobo: Tough Life leans heavily on its story content. Experience dozens of storylines inspired by real-life events and people. Solve quests, meet unique NPCs, gain their trust, make allies and enemies, join various factions, and find your place in the streets of Praslav.Maybe there is no warm apartment waiting for you at the end of the day, but you do not have to keep sleeping on park benches either. Find a suitable place and get to work. Construct walls and roofs to shield you from the elements. Gather discarded furniture and curios to furnish your hideout and make it truly your own.Is surviving on your own too difficult? Get the gang together. The game supports online co-op multiplayer for up to 4 players. Play alone, together with your friends, or even with total strangers. Team up, collect resources, build a shanty town, survive the winter.For over a decade, no one has been able to bring the many factions of the homeless together. The throne of the Homeless King has been sitting empty for far too long. Who will earn enough respect and prove themselves worthy of uniting the homeless? Will you rise to the occasion?",

If the rival has a ship on these coordinates (the coordinates are occupied), then the ship or part of it is considered to be destroyed, and the striker gets the right to make one more turn. The player's goal is to first hit all enemy ships.This project is the first public released on Steam for us. We change the familiar formula and the game concept by introducing our new rules and game modes that significantly transform the gameplay inside of it.Inside there are two versions of the game, each one represents a different gaming experience, the classic &quot;DOS-version&quot; and modern &quot;Remastered&quot;.The classic version offers you to play the game based on a special engine written by Turbo Pascal for launching from the DOS environment. Feel nostalgic for the 80-90s, when the games were pixelated, colorful and bright, and the gameplay is not so convoluted. This version has 2D sprite graphics with support of 256 colors. Among the game modes there is only a standard according to the classic rules (for now) for one and two players in the Hot-seat mode (turn-based).In this version of the game, we use the full capabilities of the modern 3D engine to make the gameplay more interactive and exciting, and the strategic part is more visually saturated.&quot;In the development process of the DOS version of the game we were restrained by a huge number of environmental restrictions, with which we could not do anything, then in this version our freedom is practically unlimited, and we can realize almost all our new ideas and game mechanics.&quot;In addition to the mode with standard rules in this version there are also new ones that greatly change the gameplay and the strategic component of the game. Also in addition to this, the &quot;Global Campaign Mode&quot; is in development, which turns the game into a real-time strategy game with its economic system and rules: leveling up, fleet management, territory control and battles, all of this and much more awaits you in the &quot;Global Campaign Mode&quot;(also includes multiplayer).

Their lives were filled with parties, study sleepovers, and everything best friends did. After all, you develop a bond after 8 years. However, there is a dark secret that clouds this friendship; one that has haunted certain members of the group for years.\r\n\r\nThe day before their graduation, on their way to their marching practice, they are kidnapped and taken to a remote location, their long-term memories locked away and leaving them frightened. Stainless steel bracelets decorate their wrists and they find themselves in the dead center of a sterile white room with one TV on the far wall and a locked door opposite of it.\r\n\r\nThe TV comes on and you learn that a dark secret has been hidden from Kris. The only way out for Kris and his friends is for him to discover it.\r\n\r\n&quot;I cannot wait until the truth is revealed...

        "About the Game": "Kris, Rosa, Peter, Xavier, and Lisa are friends for life. They went through high school together and all managed to wind up in the same community college. Their lives were filled with parties, study sleepovers, and everything best friends did. After all, you develop a bond after 8 years. However, there is a dark secret that clouds this friendship; one that has haunted certain members of the group for years.\r\n\r\nThe day before their graduation, on their way to their marching practice, they are kidnapped and taken to a remote location, their long-term memories locked away and leaving them frightened. Stainless steel bracelets decorate their wrists and they find themselves in the dead center of a sterile white room with one TV on the far wall and a locked door opposite of it.\r\n\r\nThe TV comes on and you learn that a dark secret has been hidden from Kris. The only way out for Kris and his friends is for him to discover it.\r\n\r\n&quot;I cannot wait until the truth is revealed... What will you do, I wonder...&quot;\r\n\r\nWho will leave?\r\n\r\nCreative Team:\r\n\r\nGame/Plot Design by Ethan Nakashima\r\nStory Development/GUI Design by Michaela Laws\r\nSprite and CG Art by ReddArt\r\nBackground Art by Badriel\r\nMusic by Christopher Escalante\r\nSound Effects by Jonah Scott\r\nStory Edits by Natasha Laws\r\nJournal Edits by D.

After a violent plane crash, Stanley must search a desolate frozen island in search of his wife Leonore while covering up any traces of their bloody Irish past.  Rescue help is on the way, the past must remain hidden. &quot;They can't find out who we are!&quot;​Inspirations include Dear Esther, Gone Home and Firewatch as well as dark character dramas like Homeland, Lost, and The Americans. ​The Fidelio Incident was also inspired by Beethoven's only opera,  Fidelio.  We use the opera's premise as inspiration for the backstory, then re-imagined it for a modern setting.Michael Krikorian's score composes over 40 minutes of original music.  He incorporates themes from Fidelio's overture and transforms them to fit the mood and atmosphere of the game.  The score expands the emotional depth of the narrative while complementing the atmosphere of the island.  ​Stanley is played by Glenn Keogh, known for his roles in Transformers Age of Extinction, Once Upon A Time, and Sons of Anarchy.  Glenn was born in Ireland.  After reading the script, he signed on with the goal of bringing authenticity to Stanley's character.

        "Detailed Description": "The Last Sigil is a roguelite action RPG.Create your guild, hire randomly generated characters with different traits, stats and skills, and enter the Sigils to vanquish an ancient evil and his army of monsters.Fight hordes of enemies in procedural generated dungeons, hunt for rare loot, find pets, trade and gamble with merchants, craft your own items and upgrade and enchant them using tools, magic scrolls and jewels.Distribute stat points and customize your guild through passive upgrades; earn exp and fame, level up, hire new members, become more powerful and reach the Last Sigil.SHORT DESCRIPTION- Procedurally generated exteriors and dungeons with different enemies, traps and bosses.- Three difficulties, normal, hard and very hard.- Randomly generated characters with different traits, statistics and skills and the possibility to rename them as you like.- Ten classes (fire mage, ice mage, blood witch, necromancer, cleric, paladin, amazon, ranger, berserker and juggernaut), each one with different combat abilities, a quick movement skill, an active block skill to mitigate the damage and a summonable banner which grants temporary buffs.- 50 levels, stats points to distribute between power, energy and vitality and upgrade points to spend in passive skills.- Items of different qualities, normal, magic, rare, epic and mythic (the latter with special effects), crafting materials, tools to upgrade and add sockets to your equipment, magic scrolls to enchant your items and craftable jewels to insert in sockets and further customize your equipment.- Trading, gambling, crafting and enchating.- Summonable banners which grant you temporary buffs.- Pets to bring with you and fight along your side.LONG DESCRIPTIONDUNGEONS AND ENEMIESThere are currently eight procedurally generated dungeons or Sigils, which you can enter through portals spawned in a procedurally generated world. Each dungeon is filled with different enemies, traps and bosses and consists of three levels and a boss room linked with portals.There are three types of enemies:- minions which are weak and easy to kill- elites which are tougher, stronger, with special passive bonuses and skills- bosses which you will encounter at the end of each dungeonAll of them have got normal and special attacks, you can face-tank the normal ones, but you should try to avoid or block the latter, especially if you are fighting against elites and bosses or you are not playing at normal difficulty. On top of that, only few bosses are tank&amp;spank, most of them have got also particular mechanics which might kill you if you fail to counter them.DIFFICULTIESThere are three difficulties, Normal, Hard and Very Hard, with the first one for beginner and the latter for experienced players; you have to complete the game at Normal to unlock Hard, and finish it at Hard to unlock Very Hard. Increasing the difficulty will increase your gold and magic find cap but it will also make the enemies stronger and tougher and you will have less time to avoid the enemies special attacks.TRAVELLINGThe exteriors and the dungeons are connected through exits, portals and waypoints; you can unlock the latter by clicking on them and they allow you to travel from a location to another in no time. In addition you can also teleport to the encampment (the town-hub) whenever you want, as long as you are out of combat, and you can use a portal to go back to your previous location.CHARACTERSThe members of your guild are randomly generated, they have a rank, an expertise, a trait, four statistics (strength, endurance, constitution and luck) and a set of skills. You can't create the perfect character, you have to play with what the game offers you and do your best with it.At the beginning of the game and after every dungeon, you will be able to recruit new members and select one of them to play with. You can't change their passive abilities, nor their active skills, but you can increase some of their bonuses by killing the bosses inside the dungeons and staying alive..because when you die, you will lose the character you were playing with.If you have a change of mind and you no longer like a specific character that you have hired before, you can always kick him/her from the guild and hire a new one. You can also rename the members of your guild, maybe after some of your idols or your friends or your subscribers (if you are a streamer).CLASSES AND SKILLSCurrently there are ten classes: fire mage, ice mage, blood witch, necromancer, cleric, paladin, amazon, ranger, berserker and juggernaut; each one with different combat abilities, a quick movement skill, an active block skill to mitigate the damage and a summonable banner which grants temporary buffs.There are many types of skills, ranged, melee, piercing projectiles, explosive projectiles, channelings, frontal AOE, 360° AOE, single target DOT, AOE DOT, summonings, etc. You can boost them with passive upgrades and you can add special effects too by using mythic items.LEVELS, STATISTICS AND UPGRADESBy killing enemies you will earn experience and level up until level 50. You can reach the maximum level in every difficulty, so if you just want to relax and play only at Normal, you can stick to it all the way.Each level awards you some statistic points to distribute between power, energy and vitality which are in common among all the members of your guild and they are boosted from the statistics of the character you're currently using. You also gain one upgrade point, which you can spend to select and improve some passive abilities and if you have a change of mind you can reset everything for free.Each character has also got a statistic called luck, this bonus gives a chance to double your loot every time you kill an enemy or break/open a container; on top of that you can also stack magic and gold find through the bonuses of your equipment and the passive upgrades to gain more gold and increase the chance to find rare items.ITEMSThe equipment consists of 14 slots: helmet, chest, gloves, pants, boots, amulet, two rings, three type of weapon (melee, ranged and magic), a shield, a banner and a pet.You can hunt for rare items by killing enemies or looting containers and treasure chests. You can also buy and sell from/to merchants in the encampment and gamble for unidentified items; or if you like to craft, you can gather materials and craft your own equipment at the forge.There are five qualities of items, normal, magic, rare, epic and mythic; all the items but the normal ones (which are needed for crafting), increase your character's statistics and add some passive bonuses. The better quality, the more and stronger are the bonuses. On top of that mythic items come with a special effect which will greatly enhance your character.PETSWhen you equip a pet it will be summoned at your side and it will follow you and fight with you. Your pet will attack any enemy on sight but you can call it back to you whenever you want and set it to passive mode. Some pets are melee, other are ranged and all of them have got a special ability. Like items, pets come in different qualities, from normal to mythic, and you can also boost them by spending upgrade points in the relative skills.",
        "Short Description": "The Last Sigil is a roguelite action RPG. Create your guild, hire randomly generated characters with different traits, stats and skills, and enter the Sigils to vanquish an ancient evil and his army of monsters.",
        "About the Game": "The Last Sigil is a roguelite action RPG.Create your guild, hire randomly generated characters with different traits, stats and skills, and enter the Sigils to vanquish an ancient evil and his army of monsters.Fight hordes of enemies in procedural generated dungeons, hunt for rare loot, find pets, trade and gamble with merchants, craft your own items and upgrade and enchant them using tools, magic scrolls and jewels.Distribute stat points and customize your guild through passive upgrades; earn exp and fame, level up, hire new members, become more powerful and reach the Last Sigil.SHORT DESCRIPTION- Procedurally generated exteriors and dungeons with different enemies, traps and bosses.- Three difficulties, normal, hard and very hard.- Randomly generated characters with different traits, statistics and skills and the possibility to rename them as you like.- Ten classes (fire mage, ice mage, blood witch, necromancer, cleric, paladin, amazon, ranger, berserker and juggernaut), each one with different combat abilities, a quick movement skill, an active block skill to mitigate the damage and a summonable banner which grants temporary buffs.- 50 levels, stats points to distribute between power, energy and vitality and upgrade points to spend in passive skills.- Items of different qualities, normal, magic, rare, epic and mythic (the latter with special effects), crafting materials, tools to upgrade and add sockets to your equipment, magic scrolls to enchant your items and craftable jewels to insert in sockets and further customize your equipment.- Trading, gambling, crafting and enchating.- Summonable banners which grant you temporary buffs.- Pets to bring with you and fight along your side.LONG DESCRIPTIONDUNGEONS AND ENEMIESThere are currently eight procedurally generated dungeons or Sigils, which you can enter through portals spawned in a procedurally generated world. Each dungeon is filled with different enemies, traps and bosses and consists of three levels and a boss room linked with portals.There are three types of enemies:- minions which are weak and easy to kill- elites which are tougher, stronger, with special passive bonuses and skills- bosses which you will encounter at the end of each dungeonAll of them have got normal and special attacks, you can face-tank the normal ones, but you should try to avoid or block the latter, especially if you are fighting against elites and bosses or you are not playing at normal difficulty. On top of that, only few bosses are tank&amp;spank, most of them have got also particular mechanics which might kill you if you fail to counter them.DIFFICULTIESThere are three difficulties, Normal, Hard and Very Hard, with the first one for beginner and the latter for experienced players; you have to complete the game at Normal to unlock Hard, and finish it at Hard to unlock Very Hard. Increasing the difficulty will increase your gold and magic find cap but it will also make the enemies stronger and tougher and you will have less time to avoid the enemies special attacks.TRAVELLINGThe exteriors and the dungeons are connected through exits, portals and waypoints; you can unlock the latter by clicking on them and they allow you to travel from a location to another in no time. In addition you can also teleport to the encampment (the town-hub) whenever you want, as long as you are out of combat, and you can use a portal to go back to your previous location.CHARACTERSThe members of your guild are randomly generated, they have a rank, an expertise, a trait, four statistics (strength, endurance, constitution and luck) and a set of skills. You can't create the perfect character, you have to play with what the game offers you and do your best with it.At the beginning of the game and after every dungeon, you will be able to recruit new members and select one of them to play with. You can't change their passive abilities, nor their active skills, but you can increase some of their bonuses by killing the bosses inside the dungeons and staying alive..because when you die, you will lose the character you were playing with.If you have a change of mind and you no longer like a specific character that you have hired before, you can always kick him/her from the guild and hire a new one. You can also rename the members of your guild, maybe after some of your idols or your friends or your subscribers (if you are a streamer).CLASSES AND SKILLSCurrently there are ten classes: fire mage, ice mage, blood witch, necromancer, cleric, paladin, amazon, ranger, berserker and juggernaut; each one with different combat abilities, a quick movement skill, an active block skill to mitigate the damage and a summonable banner which grants temporary buffs.There are many types of skills, ranged, melee, piercing projectiles, explosive projectiles, channelings, frontal AOE, 360° AOE, single target DOT, AOE DOT, summonings, etc. You can boost them with passive upgrades and you can add special effects too by using mythic items.LEVELS, STATISTICS AND UPGRADESBy killing enemies you will earn experience and level up until level 50.

Really loud death metal. But I had always been interested in electronic music as well and started to make it. I will have some music and it will inspire me to make something visual. It’s all very integrated because the music inspires the visuals but the visuals also inspire the music. It’s a constant interaction between the two. I like to go into the details. I can work for a year on a small piece but I make it exactly how I want. VR is a really intense and immersive way to experience music. The best way I can describe Apex is like when I was fifteen and went to a death metal concert, and what I felt being in the crowd as the band played, the aggression and the energy. It’s overwhelming and kind of scary but it makes you feel something. And that’s what I wanted to do with Apex. There is destruction but there is also beauty in what you are seeing. It’s really more of an atmosphere than a traditional story.\r\n\r\nWith VR it’s really hard to tell a story in the traditional sense. You visualize it in your mind in the traditional way, different shots, controlling the frame. But in VR when a character walks away they are still in the world, so you have to think about it in a much different way than films. So something like Apex is more of a pure atmosphere. And that’s what I’m interested in doing now, putting people in worlds more than telling traditional stories in those worlds. I like it when people take off the headset and have to adjust to the earth again.&quot;\r\n\r\n-Arjan van Meerten, Creator",

        "Detailed Description": "Illwinter's Floorplan Generator is a grid based dungeon and wilderness floorplan creator. The floorplan generator can be used to quickly draw and print an encounter floorplan for your favorite pen and paper roleplaying game. It is very quick and easy to create a simple floorplan, you just select what terrain type each square should be and the program fixes the rest. E.g. a cave wall next to a rocky ground will automatically create a jagged wall, but the same cave wall next to a marble floor would create a much smoother wall because this is likely to be an indoor room with polished walls.    About 50 different terrain types to choose from    Icons included for the most common objects, e.g. doors, stairs, tables, beds, trees, bushes, pentagrams    Color maps or old school black and white style    Adjacent terrains interact automatically to create jagged edges, smooth transitions and shadows when necessary    Random fractals used to create shapes for cave walls, rivers and other non regular terrains    Create a multi-page pdf with the dungeon divided into pages suitable for printing    Export dungeon as a single png suitable for Foundry VTT, Roll20, Fantasy Grounds and similar applications    Export wall data that can be used for dynamic lightning in Foundry VTT or Roll20 (requires roll20 pro subscription)    Configurable square and paper sizes, (default is 1 inch squares on A4 pages)    Outdoor and dungeon shadows with configurable strength    Export to your favorite paint program for finishing touches    Import your own icons    Create new terrain types from imported images    Configurable grid, default is to not draw it on top of walls and with thicker lines between pages    Grid based, terrain is placed in squares or on square edges (icons can be placed and rotated freely)    Shortcuts to quickly put a random door, tree or bush in a square    Dungeon layout can be imported from a simple ASCII text file, like this     Create random dungeons automatically    Editor to create rules for your own random dungeon    Color dungeons can be converted to Black &amp; White style dungeons automatically    Export with a 3d look    Steam workshop support",

The situation is extremely alarming and there is nothing the police or the city security guards can do! The press slams the government and sarcastically talks about the alleys of Tehran turning into scenes from Western movies. Each day a new murder is committed, a new family mourns for its loved ones and more people are gripped by fear; fear of being the next victim… \r\nBut who are the victims of such heinous murders, anyways? The rich? The politicians? Or the upper class? “None”, is the answer. The victims are innocent children from southern neighborhoods; what wrong they have done to be drawn into this diabolical game is not known! There is no clue as to the murderer’s whereabouts.\r\nThe high degree of violence in these murders is what attracts the attention. Most victims are tortured before death and are then brutally sliced into pieces! Such unbridled violence increases social tensions even more. While the general situation in Tehran becomes more and more chaotic as days go by, Colonel Nasiri, the chief of police, assigns the case to one of his elite officers, detective Afshar, in hope of saving the people and city of Tehran by virtue of the intellect of this compassionate and patriotic officer.\r\nBut, is the murderer a mere crazy sadist? All evidence points to such a conclusion. However, a journalist, named Sarsalouki, has another interpretation in mind! He believes that some forces are working hand in glove with the murderer, meaning that, not only they are not unhappy about these events but are flaring up social rage and feeding off of the fear pervading the society! But who is the murderer, anyways?\r\n\r\n(This version of the game has been fully reviewed for redistribution on STEAM in terms of the translation of dialogues, scripts, and other localization segments in English and is different from the previous version)\r\n\r\nGame features:\r\n\r\n1.\tAn intriguing, engaging story in a noir atmosphere similar to that of serial killings\r\n2.\tLoyalty to the Adventure genre with more than 6 mini games and tens of environmental puzzles\r\n3.\tTens of graphic documents, newspapers, short stories, and old advertisements\r\n4.\tNarrated in more than 12 locations and 80 backgrounds with meticulous detail\r\n5.\t23 characters with more than 100 A4 pages of captivating dialogue.\r\n6.\tMore than 15 minutes of motion comic for a more detailed narration of the story.\r\n7.\t20 minutes of engaging noir music\r\n8.\t60 pages of completely interactive daily notes by the detective\r\n9.\tMore than 4 hours of gameplay",

It is freely available on the Steam VR app store. With IRB consent we collect behavioral data and survey response questions in an Internet-connected immersive virtual environment. Our first alpha experiment involves simulated social scenes to measure social anxiety. This data will be used to create an empirical foundation for a free, automated intervention to treat social anxiety disorder. We also hope to open the platform to other researchers who can collected data with Unity-based environments in PsychLabVR.

Inspired by old-school games like Dungeon Master I and II, the Eye of the Beholder series, and the most recent Legend of Grimrock I and II. Stranded in the middle of an ocean, in front of a gigantic tower, the hero has to find out what the place is, what happened there, and most importantly, who he is.First person real-time combatPuzzles and level-wide objectivesGadget-based RPG systemLots of exploration, loot, and character customizationMysterious storyline filled with secretsFully voiced main charactersImmersive steampunk settingCombat takes place in real time. Each enemy has a distinctive set of strengths and weaknesses so you have to employ different tactics to beat each one. Weapon types have each a set of unique bonuses and behaviors which adds more depth and thought when choosing what weapons to equip.You will find many types of gadgets: direct attacks, area attacks, offensive &amp; defensive buffs... These gadgets are powerful, but some enemies are immune to certain types of attacks, so you will have to figure out the best way to deal with every encounter the game throws at you.Solve intriguing puzzles and level-wide objectives where you have to use both your wits and reflexes. While most puzzles and riddles are contained in a single room, progression objectives can span an entire level or even multiple levels.Instead of increasing the abilities of your human character, you will improve an exoskeleton rig you wear. The game combines a &quot;you are what you wear&quot; aspect with a long-term development of your exo-rig. The gadget-based system allows you change your loadout of gadgets at any time, giving you a great deal of flexibility to deal with various situations. On the other hand, as you progress, you get to unlock useful circuits on your exo-rig, gaining significant permanent attribute bonuses and passive skills.Stranded on a small islet in the middle of an ocean, you enter a gigantic mechanical tower. Nothing makes sense to you, but it is all strangely familiar...If you want to get into the backstory and uncover the mysteries of the tower, you can delve right into it by reading all the notes you can find. Don't worry, though, you can safely ignore all the text. All major story points are narrated by the main characters and they are fully voiced!There are many optional areas in the game that you can choose to explore. They usually present some form of additional challenge, but come with a reward too! The tower is riddled with secret passages that contain unique items and notes of its inhabitants, giving you an insight into their lives and events that precede your arrival.",

Special themed levels with unique hazards, creatures and layouts. Randomly generated, and each floor has multiple possible levels, so each playthrough is different! Item-less gameplay. The dead have no need for worldly possessions, they just slow you down. Quick to pick up and play.

Entirely playable with just the keyboard, just the mouse, or a combination of the two. Mod support! Add your own creatures, powers and special levels, or change the ones already there.@ Choice between graphics or ASCII mode, for the oldschool roguelike fans.Note: The &quot;demo&quot; is the full game.

        "Detailed Description": "Hi Everyone, Thanks for your support over the years. As one of the only two people behind VectorWave I would like to thank everyone who ever downloaded my game from the bottom of my heart. I've been making plans to revive this game for over 2 years. I've wanted to update it to modern controllers/headsets, even give it a minor graphical facelift, but unfortunately my time is very limited. As of now, VectorWave is dead. You can only play it if you have an original HTC Vive or a first or second gen oculus. This bring me no joy, but after 2 years of attempting to get the time to work on it, I believe it's finally time to throw in the towel. Any free time I get will go towards new game ideas of endeavors I may have. Thanks again.VectorWave translates the traditional tower defense experience into virtual reality, allowing you the freedom to buy, place, toss, and move towers as you see fit between each wave with almost no need for menus. Each hand serves its own purpose in your efforts to build an impenetrable defense grid against increasingly difficult hordes of malware bent on destroying your mainframe.Moving from a 2-D top down perspective in traditional TD games to Virtual Reality allows us to expand on this genre like never before. Because split second decisions and positioning matter, VectorWave's simple, yet versatile, movement and scaling system allows you to either stand directly in the action, or watch your carefully laid out plans from afar. Current Game Features    21 Levels    20 Enemy Types    22 Towers    Unique Player Abilities    Achievements    Global Leader-boards    Trading CardsPlanned Features    Level Editor    Challenge Mode    Endless ModeGame currently supports the HTC Vive and the Oculus RiftDemo DetailsWe included a Demo you could try before you purchase the full product.

        "Detailed Description": "The Family Office UpdateNOTHING SUCCEEDS LIKE SUCCESS.As a trader, you’ve amassed enough wealth for FERIOS that somebody in the Miller Family Office has decided to retain you as their personal financial advisor. Will you fail miserably, or will you be so successful that even more powerful and shadowy members of the family make you their golden goose instead?In this update to The Invisible Hand, explore a new and improved Endless Mode that will allow you to gradually control entire percentages of the global economy on behalf of the wealthiest people nobody has ever heard of.As an Endless Mode player, your options are immeasurable. Do you have what it takes to make the numbers so big that it forces us to patch the game to allow for even bigger numbers? Can you delay our future projects and ruin our lives for the sake of a pointless abstraction? Can you test the implied warranty of the word ‘endless’ for some indecipherable purpose? The choice is yours.Of course, Endless Mode will be accessible to all players who purchase The Invisible Hand whether they begin by playing through the original campaign or not - just don’t say we didn’t warn you.About the GameCongrats on your new job! Welcome to the first-person world of a mid-level stockbroker, as you begin your very first day at the trading firm FERIOS. You’ve probably wanted this job since you were six, right? Well, so have a lot of people… so you'll have to fight for it and prove that you're the top dog for the job!Just remember: profit is all that matters, the rules don’t apply if you’re a winner, and only losers feel guilty for the pain, loss and poverty that are the unfortunate but unavoidable by-product of the critical and important work we do here.It’s simple: your job is to make money for FERIOS.  Buy the stocks going up, sell before they go down. Short the ones that are going to fall (or the ones you’re going to make fall). The more money you make, the bigger your commission. And you want that commission, don't you? Well don’t worry, the rewards are limitless, if you’re hungry enough.If you’re really smart, you’ll find ways to influence the market to your advantage. Think you can lobby an influential group to affect the market? Do it. Get an opportunity to acquire majority shares to move the needle? Take it.  Drive down the currency of a foreign country to improve the margins of the companies that import their products? Why not? The only consequences that matter are the ones that impact our bottom line.Every Joe Schmo has access to the regular news. If you want to get ahead of the spikes and crashes you’ll need to find the inside line from more, shall we say, “exclusive” sources. And definitely don’t let those rumors of a financial investigation get you down. No one employed by FERIOS has ever been found guilty! We’re one big happy team here at Ferios and nothing brings the team together like competition. So in the spirit of togetherness you better meet your daily profit targets and beat your coworkers’ results if you want to keep your job. We won’t hesitate to fire anyone who can’t or won’t do what it takes to succeed...  The fruits of success are yours for the taking. Fast cars, lavish parties, fancy apartments filled with beautiful furniture and artworks. Of course, for any truly successful trader, work is its own reward and their true home is the office so it’s a good thing you can decorate your desk with photos of all your wonderful things to remind you they exist.",

        "Detailed Description": "In a universe driven by targets, a faceless corporation employs you to create an evolving ecosystem you can never hope to control...Intelligent Design: An Evolutionary Sandbox is a god game with fully simulated genetics and evolution. Create species of plants, herbivores and carnivores and try to control the ever evolving ecosystem. Design and create genetically modified organisms, but remember when you start tampering with genetics it is hard to undo your mistakes...This is a game for people who don’t want to be given all the answers. A game for people who like to experiment with a simulation, at their own pace, and watch what happens.Key FeaturesFully modeled genetics and evolutionThe behavior of each organism are determined by their genetics.  How tall will a plant grow? How fast can an herbivore run? How often does a carnivore seek prey?  These genetics are passed down generation after generation along with random mutations.  Evolution is fully simulated, there are no tricks or statistical approximations. You are watching life evolve on your computer.Science to be DoneWhat do all those genes actually do?  How is the world score calculated?  What does world efficiency even mean?

        "About the Game": "In a universe driven by targets, a faceless corporation employs you to create an evolving ecosystem you can never hope to control...Intelligent Design: An Evolutionary Sandbox is a god game with fully simulated genetics and evolution. Create species of plants, herbivores and carnivores and try to control the ever evolving ecosystem. Design and create genetically modified organisms, but remember when you start tampering with genetics it is hard to undo your mistakes...This is a game for people who don’t want to be given all the answers. A game for people who like to experiment with a simulation, at their own pace, and watch what happens.Key FeaturesFully modeled genetics and evolutionThe behavior of each organism are determined by their genetics.  How tall will a plant grow? How fast can an herbivore run? How often does a carnivore seek prey?  These genetics are passed down generation after generation along with random mutations.  Evolution is fully simulated, there are no tricks or statistical approximations. You are watching life evolve on your computer.Science to be DoneWhat do all those genes actually do?  How is the world score calculated?  What does world efficiency even mean?

There is almost no atmosphere at the surface. At the same time the planet is pitted by caves that go many thousands kilometers down and keep all the life and air inside.Koyte is really the planet of caves.

Everything is different on the planet now. Something happened to those ancient forerunners. Now this mysterious world is divided into two - upper and lower ones. Some rational beings live in the upper world. Probably they are descendants of the ancient people as they feel quite cozy and good here. Life of the lower world is completely different. Ugly creatures, blood-thirsty predators, that know no mercy, live in the lower world. There is nothing more hated for them than the inhabitants of the upper world! No one inhabitant of the upper world would voluntarily go down to the lower world.

He masters new types of weapons and protection.BlackEye becomes more sturdy and stronger with each battle.

This magical energy is now growing scarce, and wars for survival are devastating the lands as magical beings fight over the last remaining scraps of this life-giving force. Somewhere, legendary creatures sleep an ageless slumber, hiding in their hearts the original Mana source. Only a few chosen ones can awaken these Creatures and guide them to save Thasys. They are the witnesses of a dying world, the last hope for the living.They are the PRODIGIES.Prodigy Tactics is a tactical turn-based game set in a fantastic world of Thasys, torn in a never-ending war.

During that time, I've been at work on a rewritten voxel engine with &quot;infinite&quot; worlds, lots of new features, and more thought put into cross-platform support.The Steam version was made free on July 11th, 2022 (without a feature update). The new version of Microcosm will be coming to iOS first, and will be free with in-app purchases for some of the new functionality (such as Lua scripting and PLY/OBJ export). I don't have a set release date, but once the iOS version is out, I'll start work on the VR update. When the VR update is released, anyone who purchased Microcosm before July 11th, 2022 will be entitled to a free code granting them access to all new features.Thanks for your patience!-paul~~~~~~~~~~Build tiny voxel worlds in virtual reality!Microcosm is the game I've wanted to play in VR ever since I saw the Oculus Rift Kickstarter way back in 2012. I picked up a Vive last year (2016), but no one seemed to be making the voxel game I wanted. Finally, I said enough was enough, and just decided to build it myself.I hope you enjoy playing Microcosm as much as I enjoy making it.
